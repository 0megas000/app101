## The Full Tale Version

*This is the longer version told by storytellers, priests, and scholars. Different tellers emphasize different elements:*

### Once, Long Ago...

In the time before time had names, when the world was younger and stranger than you can imagine, there lived Three who were not quite mortal and not quite divine. Some called them gods. Others called them simply the Three. They had no parents that anyone knew, and no one could say where they came from or when they first appeared.

But everyone agreed on this: they were powerful beyond measure, and they shaped the world we know.

### The Seer of All Sight

The First was known as the Seer, though some called him the Blind Prophet, for his eyes held no pupils—only swirling darkness that reflected everything that was, is, or would ever be.

The Seer could look at a child and see the old man he would become. He could look at a seed and see the mighty tree and its eventual rot. He could look at a kingdom and see its rise and its inevitable fall. Nothing was hidden from him. Every truth, every lie, every secret revealed itself before his gaze.

Kings sought his counsel. Warriors begged for prophecies of victory. Lovers pleaded to know if their affections would be returned. And the Seer answered, for he could not help but see and speak the truth.

But knowing all things is a terrible burden.

He saw betrayals before they happened and could not stop them. He saw deaths approaching and could not prevent them. He saw the small cruelties people would commit and the large kindnesses they would never know they almost showed. Every moment of every life played out before him in infinite possibility, and he was powerless to change any of it.

"I am tired," he said one day, to no one in particular, for he was always alone despite the crowds that sought him. "I am tired of seeing. I am tired of knowing. I am tired of watching tomorrow become yesterday while today slips through my fingers like water."

And so the Seer walked to a hidden lake where the stars reflected in water dark as night. He knelt by its shore and closed his eyes—truly closed them, for the first time since the world began. And as he did, the water rose up to embrace him, pulling him down into its depths where he could finally, blessedly, see nothing at all.

There he sleeps still, they say, dreaming of a future where not everything must be known.

### The Shaper of Forms

The Second was called the Shaper, though some knew her as the Transformer, for her hands could reshape reality as a potter shapes clay.

She could touch a stone and make it sing. She could whisper to a tree and it would dance. She could embrace a wolf and it would become a man, or embrace a man and make him something entirely new. Nothing had to stay as it was—everything could be more, could be different, could be *better*.

Artists sought her blessing. Healers begged her to reshape broken bodies. The sick pleaded for transformation into the healthy. The ugly wished to be beautiful, and the weak wished to be strong. And the Shaper obliged, for she delighted in possibility and potential.

But after countless ages of change, she grew weary too.

Every perfect form she created eventually disappointed someone. Every improvement revealed a flaw. Every transformation made something new but destroyed what came before. Change, she realized, was neither good nor evil—it simply *was*, inevitable and endless as a river that never reaches the sea.

"I am tired," she said, her voice echoing across dimensions of reality she herself had created. "I am tired of changing things. I am tired of making what is into what might be. I am tired of destroying to create and creating only to see it destroyed in turn."

And so the Shaper walked to the edge of reality itself, to a place where possibilities bleed together like colors in water. She stepped forward, allowing change to take her, becoming something not-quite-solid, not-quite-real, not-quite-anything at all. She became pure potential, sleeping in a state between all states, waiting to be shaped as she had once shaped others.

There she sleeps still, they say, dreaming of a world where nothing must change and everything already is.

### The Ender of All Things

The Third was named the Ender, though some called him the Final Rest, for wherever he walked, things came to their conclusion.

Stories ended when he listened. Lives completed when he witnessed. Kingdoms fell when he passed through. Not cruelly, not with malice—simply as a natural consequence of his presence. He was the full stop at the end of every sentence, the final curtain on every play, the last breath before silence.

Those in pain sought his mercy. The ancient wished for his release. The suffering begged for an end to their torment. And the Ender came, for he understood that all things must conclude, and that was neither tragedy nor triumph—merely truth.

But being the end of all things is lonely work.

He could never have friends, for they would end. He could never love, for it would end. He could never build or create, for it would only end. He existed in the terrible space after everything finishes but before anything new begins, and that space is cold and empty and eternal.

"I am tired," he said to the silence that was his only companion. "I am tired of ending things. I am tired of being the conclusion to stories I never got to hear. I am tired of closing doors I never got to open."

And so the Ender walked to the highest mountain, to a peak so tall it touched the empty sky. He lay down upon the bare stone, closed his eyes, and for the first time since existence began, he chose not to end something. He chose instead to simply... stop. Not to conclude, not to finish, but to pause, incomplete and unresolved.

There he sleeps still, they say, dreaming of beginnings instead of endings.

### The Warning

And that, children, is why the Three sleep.

Not because they died—for how can you kill what was never fully alive? Not because they were defeated—for who could defeat them? But because they chose to rest, to escape the burdens that even immortals find too heavy to bear.

The Seer sleeps because knowing everything is agony.  
The Shaper sleeps because changing everything is exhausting.  
The Ender sleeps because ending everything is lonely.

And the wise say: let them sleep.

For if the Seer wakes, he will see every shameful thing you've done and every terrible thing you'll do, and you will not be able to hide. For if the Shaper wakes, she will transform everything you know into something unrecognizable, and nothing will remain as it was. For if the Ender wakes, he will bring everything to its conclusion, including things that should continue, including you.

Some say they sleep beneath mountains. Others say they sleep in lakes, or in the spaces between heartbeats, or in dreams we all share but can never quite remember. Some say they aren't sleeping at all—they're waiting. Waiting for the moment when the world needs them again, or when someone foolish enough tries to wake them, or when their long rest finally ends of its own accord.

But until that day comes, let them sleep.

And if you should ever find a place where the stars reflect in black water, or where reality bends and shifts like heat shimmer, or where everything seems to pause on the edge of ending—walk away. Walk away and do not look back. For those are the places where the Three might wake.

And children, you do not want to be there when they do.

*The end.*

## Scholarly Interpretations

*Different factions and scholars interpret the tale differently:*

### [[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] Interpretation

"The tale is a warning against hubris. The Three were powerful beings—perhaps angels, perhaps demons, perhaps something else—who grew tired of existence because they lacked faith in the divine order. They abandoned their responsibilities and now sleep in disgrace.

The moral is clear: duty must be fulfilled regardless of weariness. To sleep when the world needs you is to abandon your purpose. The Three made themselves examples of what not to do.

Some heretics claim they were gods themselves, but this is blasphemy. There is only one divine truth, and it does not sleep."

**- Cardinal-Scholar Thomas Brightshield**

### [[🧪 Empirical Academy]] Interpretation

"The tale is clearly metaphorical—a primitive attempt to explain natural phenomena through personification. The 'Seer' likely represents the unpredictability of fate and our inability to control future events. The 'Shaper' symbolizes the constant flux of nature and evolution. The 'Ender' personifies entropy and the heat death of the universe.

The current corruption crisis has given the tale renewed relevance. Planar convergence creates reality distortions that primitive peoples would have interpreted as 'sleeping gods stirring.' We must separate myth from measurable phenomenon.

Though I admit, some of the tale's details are... troublingly specific."

**- [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]], private notes**

### [[🌀 Ascendant Cult]] Interpretation

"The tale is a prophecy of transformation! The Shaper chose to become change itself—she didn't abandon the world, she *embraced* it at a deeper level. When she wakes, she will reshape reality into something more beautiful, more perfect, more *true*.

We don't fear her awakening—we long for it! The Shaper represents evolution, growth, transcendence. To sleep is not to die but to gestate, to transform in the chrysalis before emerging as something magnificent.

The tale warns against waking them only because primitive people fear change. We do not fear. We welcome."

**- [[🌀 Brother Kaine the Interpreter]]**

### [[🚶 The Pilgrims]] Interpretation

"The Three sleep, but they also dream, and their dreams shape reality even now. The corruption is not an invasion from outside—it's the Shaper's dreams bleeding through. When she dreams of change, change happens. When she dreams of transformation, things transform.

We don't wake her because she's already halfway awake. We learn to live in the space between sleeping and waking, between what is and what might be. That's what it means to walk the corruption zones—you're walking through someone else's dream, and you must learn to dream alongside them.

The tale teaches adaptation, not resistance."

**- Elder Miriam, Pilgrim Guide**

### [[👁️ Divine Awakeners]] Interpretation (Secret)

"The tale is true. Not metaphorical. Not symbolic. True.

Three beings of immense power sleep in specific physical locations. They can be awakened under the right conditions. The prophecies align with astronomical events, ritual requirements, and the presence of oracle vessels.

The Seer ([[👁️ Isril the Blind]]) sleeps beneath [[Isril's Hidden Lake]]. He requires an oracle to speak through, specific stellar alignments, and offerings of perfect truth. When he wakes, all will be revealed—every lie, every hidden thing, every secret exposed. Whether this is blessing or curse depends on what you've hidden.

We work toward his awakening because we believe truth, no matter how painful, is better than comfortable ignorance. The tale warns against waking the Three, but sometimes the world needs to wake up."

**- [[👁️ Oracle-Seeker Mardeth]]**

### [[🛡️ Pragmatic Coalition]] Interpretation

"Whether the tale is literal or metaphorical is irrelevant to our mission. What matters is how people interpret it and how that affects their behavior.

The [[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] uses it to justify their authoritarian control—'fulfill your duty, don't rest.' The [[🌀 Ascendant Cult]] uses it to justify voluntary corruption—'embrace change.' The [[🧪 Empirical Academy]] dismisses it entirely—'it's just a story.'

We focus on what's practical: the tale teaches that every power has limits, every strength becomes a burden, and rest is sometimes necessary. Apply those lessons to resource management and humanitarian aid.

Also, it's an excellent bedtime story that stops children from wandering into corruption zones. That alone makes it valuable."

**- [[🛡️ Chancellor Mira Ashford]]**

## Variations in Different Regions

### In [[⚜️ Goldspire]]

The tale is told with emphasis on the Three's *abandonment* of their duties. Religious scholars use it to teach about the importance of fulfilling one's obligations despite weariness.

Children are taught: "Even the mighty Three grew tired, but they should have persevered. Don't be like them."

### In [[🎓 Thornwick Academy]]

The tale is taught as mythology and comparative folklore. Students analyze different versions, discuss symbolic meanings, and write papers on its cultural impact.

[[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]] uses it as an example of how people create narratives to explain things they don't understand.

### In [[🏘️ Millhaven]]

The tale is told around campfires with extra scary elements added. The corruption nearby makes it feel more real—some claim to have seen the Shaper's dreams or heard the Ender's footsteps.

Parents tell it to keep children from wandering too close to the shimmer zones.

### In [[🛤️ Crossroads End]]

Multiple versions told depending on who's speaking. Faction agents use different interpretations to recruit. The tale becomes a political tool as much as a story.

[[🕵️ Mama Cordelia Voss]] uses it to teach pragmatism: "Even the gods get tired. Rest when you can, work when you must, and don't take on burdens you can't carry."

### In [[🏕️ The Outskirts]]

Refugees tell it to their children with tears in their eyes. The Three's weariness resonates with their own exhaustion. Some add verses about the Three waking to save the refugees, giving false hope.

Others add verses about the Three waking to destroy everything, reinforcing their fear.
