# The Empirical Academy

**Motto:** "Knowledge conquers superstition"
**Base:** [[🎓 Thornwick Academy]]
**Status:** Active - Leading scientific research efforts
**Faction Type:** Academic/Scientific

## **Leadership**
- **Primary:** [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]] - Archsavant, obsessive researcher who lost tenure challenging religion
- **Secondary:** [[Professor Magnus Gearwright]] - Gnomish artificer creating technological solutions
- **Military:** [[Researcher-Captain Thorne Blackwood]] - Former officer leading dangerous field expeditions
- **Support:** [[🎓 Dean Aldric Thornwick]] - University head providing official backing

## **Core Philosophy**
The sleeping gods are merely powerful extraplanar entities that can be understood, measured, and controlled through scientific methodology. Technology and empirical knowledge will solve the corruption crisis without requiring dangerous divine intervention.

## **Goals & Strategy**
### **Immediate (1-3 months):**
- Establish field research stations around corruption zones
- Develop technological detection and measurement tools
- Recruit displaced scholars and fund anti-religious research
- Prove corruption has scientific rather than divine causes

### **Medium-term (3-12 months):**
- Create technological barriers to contain corruption spread
- Develop methods to reverse reality distortion through science
- Establish Academy as premier authority on planar phenomena
- Discredit religious explanations through public education

### **Ultimate Goal:**
Complete scientific mastery of planar convergence, proving divine intervention unnecessary while establishing rational, academic governance of crisis response.
