# The Pilgrims

**Motto:** "We walk between worlds"
**Base:** Mobile settlements throughout corruption zones
**Status:** Active - Expanding territory and community
**Faction Type:** Adapted Outcasts/Corruption Survivors

## **Leadership**
- **Spokesperson:** [[Elder Veil]] - May be multiple people sharing identity, appears differently to different observers
- **Council:** [[The Wayfinder Circle]] - Five Pilgrims who navigate deepest corruption (North-Walker, South-Walker, East-Walker, West-Walker, Center-Walker)
- **Influential Voices:** No formal hierarchy, but respected community members include:
  - **"Bitter" Helena Ashworth** - Former merchant family, lost everything to anti-Pilgrim riots
  - **The Twins (Marcus & Mira)** - Children born in corruption zones, stronger there than anywhere else

## **Core Philosophy**
The corruption is not a curse but adaptation. Reality is changing whether people accept it or not, and those who learn to live with transformation will inherit the new world. Traditional society rejected them, so they will build something better in the spaces between realities.

## **Goals & Strategy**
### **Immediate (Ongoing):**
- Expand guide services to establish economic relationships with outsiders
- Create stable communities in threshold zones between corrupted and normal reality
- Document safe paths and settlement locations for other Pilgrims
- Survive persecution while building alternative society

### **Medium-term (6-18 months):**
- Establish permanent settlements that can support larger populations
- Develop unique cultural practices adapted to multi-dimensional existence
- Build trade relationships with settlements willing to work with them
- Create education systems for children born in corruption zones

### **Ultimate Goal:**
Transform the world so thoroughly that the distinction between "normal" and "corrupted" becomes meaningless, creating reality where Pilgrims aren't outcasts but the new standard of adapted humanity.
