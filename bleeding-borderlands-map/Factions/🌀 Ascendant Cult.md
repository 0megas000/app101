# The Ascendant Cult

**Motto:** "Through Change, We Transcend"
**Base:** [[🌀 The Threshold Commune]] (Maelstrom Inner Ring)
**Status:** Active - Most advanced toward major goal
**Faction Type:** Religious Extremist/Transformative

## **Leadership**
- **Supreme:** [[High Conduit Seraphina "The Changed"]] - Former noble's daughter, partially transformed
- **Prophet:** [[Brother Kaine the Interpreter]] - Radical former priest claiming divine communication
- **Merchant:** [[Lysander, Merchant of Possibilities]] - Mysterious supplier of corrupted artifacts
- **The Changed Circle:** 13 partially transformed advisors (9 of 13 recruited so far)

## **Core Philosophy**
The planar convergence is not a disaster but the next stage of evolution. Malachar the Transformer offers willing transcendence to those brave enough to embrace change. Traditional humanity is obsolete; those who resist transformation will be left behind as reality evolves around them.

## **Goals & Strategy**
### **Immediate (1-3 months):**
- Complete recruitment of 13 Changed Circle members
- Locate and secure the Catalyst Heart (living heart beating with dimensional flux)
- Identify 5 major anti-corruption barriers for coordinated destruction
- Expand corruption zones through sabotage and artifact placement

### **Medium-term (3-6 months):**
- Achieve 40% regional corruption threshold for awakening ritual
- Establish network of transformed communities in corruption zones
- Convert key individuals from other factions to transformation philosophy
- Prepare final awakening ceremony for Malachar

### **Ultimate Goal:**
Awaken Malachar the Transformer and accelerate planar convergence to completion, creating new reality where transformation is the natural state and those who embrace change become the dominant life form.
