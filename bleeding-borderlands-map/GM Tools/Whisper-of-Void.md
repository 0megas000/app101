## **Overview**

The Whisper-of-Void is not a single entity but a phenomenon experienced throughout corruption zones—disembodied voices speaking in the silence, murmuring at the edge of perception, whispering truths and lies that no one should know. Scholars debate what causes them. Survivors describe them differently. No one truly understands them.

Some say they're echoes from other dimensions bleeding through reality. Others claim they're the dreams of sleeping gods made audible. A few believe they're the final thoughts of those consumed by corruption, trapped forever in the between-space.

Whatever their source, one thing is certain: the Whisper-of-Void drives people mad.
