## The Return Journey - What Follows You

### Two Days Back to Thornwick

**Base Situation:**

- Party exhausted (unless they rested)
- Corruption points affecting some PCs
- Samples degrading without proper storage
- Being watched/followed

**What Follows Depends on Session 2 Choices:**

### Path A: Saved Many Lives

**Grateful Refugees Trail Behind**

_A caravan of 20-30 survivors follows at distance_

**Complication:** They're slowing you down

- Add 1 day to journey
- Need protection from encounters
- Consume extra resources
- But provide information/aid

**Encounter: Corruption Surge** _Reality wave chases the group_

**Choice:**

- Protect refugees (combat + skill challenge)
- Abandon them to save samples
- Split the party (high risk)

**If Protected:** Major reputation gain, refugee aid **If Abandoned:** Reputation loss, guilt, faster travel

→ Proceed to [[#Road Encounter]]

### Path B: Made Enemies

**Hostile Forces Pursue**

_Based on who you angered:_

- **Pilgrims:** Reality glitches increase
- **Faction Agents:** Sabotage attempts
- **Cultists:** Corruption creatures sent
- **All Three:** Coordinated harassment

**Pursuit Mechanics:**

- Stealth/Survival checks to evade
- Random encounters doubled
- Short rests interrupted
- Equipment sabotaged

**Major Encounter: The Ambush** Location depends on pursuer:

- Pilgrims: Reality maze trap
- Faction: Professional soldiers
- Cultists: Corrupted beasts

→ Proceed to [[#Road Encounter]]

### Path C: Carried Dark Secrets

**Something Else Noticed You**

_If party discovered god-signs or took temporal items_

**Strange Occurrences:**

- [[👁️ Samson]] appears repeatedly
- Dreams of impossible places
- Equipment behaves strangely
- Reality "glitches" around party

**Special Encounter: The Messenger** _A figure that shouldn't exist approaches_

**Identity (Roll d6):** 1-2: Future version of PC (warning) 3-4: Past echo of dead NPC 5-6: Avatar of sleeping god

**Message:** Cryptic warning about coming choice

→ Proceed to [[#Road Encounter]]

---

## Road Encounter

### The Checkpoint

**Circle Road Checkpoint - [[⚔️ Vigilant Order]] Controlled**

_Golden banners, armed templars, corruption detection_

**Templar Captain:** "Halt! All returning from corruption zones must submit to inspection and cleansing!"

### Path A: Comply Fully

**Submit to Inspection:**

**They Discover:**

- Corruption samples (illegal?)
- Faction items/symbols
- Corrupted PCs
- Hidden refugees

**Consequences Vary:**

- **If Order Allied:** Wave through with blessing
- **If Order Neutral:** Confiscate some items, lecture
- **If Order Enemy:** Arrest attempt

**Cleansing Ritual:** Removes 1d3 corruption points but damages samples

→ Proceed to [[#Academy Gates]]

### Path B: Deceive/Sneak

**Deception Options:**

- Forge documents (DC 16)
- Bribe guards (100gp)
- Create distraction
- Sneak around (group DC 14)

**Success:** Pass without inspection **Failure:** Heightened suspicion, possible combat

**If Combat:**

- 6 Guards + 1 Templar Knight
- Killing = major consequences
- Escape possible via chaos

→ Proceed to [[#Academy Gates]]

### Path C: Reveal Everything

**Tell Truth About Findings:**

_"The corruption is beyond any faction's control. We have proof."_

**Roll Persuasion:**

- **DC 18+:** Captain secretly sympathetic, provides intel
- **DC 14-17:** Allows passage but reports up chain
- **DC 13-:** Attempts arrest for "heresy"

**Sympathetic Captain Reveals:** "Three more settlements vanished yesterday. The Grandmaster plans something desperate. Be careful who you trust at the Academy."

→ Proceed to [[#Academy Gates]]
