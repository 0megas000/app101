## How Party Hears About Job

### Path A: The Tavern Board (Default)

**Location:** [[🍺 The Wanderers Rest]]

Party sees job posting on bulletin board:

> **FIELD RESEARCHERS NEEDED**
> 
> The Empirical Academy seeks capable individuals for 2-week research expedition into corruption-affected areas. Duties include: sample collection, equipment testing, documentation, and security.
> 
> Payment: 200 gold pieces per person upon successful completion
> Additional: Full provisions, equipment, academic credentials, potential ongoing work
> 
> Inquire: Observatory Complex, Thornwick Academy
> Ask for Dr. Elara Voss or Professor Magnus Gearwright

**Party Reaction Options:**
- [[#Immediately Accept]] (motivated by money/curiosity)
- [[#Investigate First]] (cautious, ask around)
- [[#Negotiate Terms]] (shrewd, want better deal)
- [[#Decline and Find Other Work]] (alternative hooks)

### Path B: Personal Recruitment

**Bartram Copperkettle Approaches Party:**

*"Overheard you lot are capable sorts. University's looking for people who can handle themselves. Research mission, pays well. Dr. Voss asked me to keep an eye out for competent folk. Interested?"*

**If Party Asks Why He Recommends Them:**
- Insight DC 12: He gets finder's fee (5gp per person recruited)
- He's honest if asked directly
- "Dr. Voss is good people. Does real work, not just theory."

→ Proceed to [[#Meeting the Academy]]

### Path C: Referral from Previous Contact

**If Party Helped Someone Earlier:**
- [[📚 Helena Brightquill]] recommends them to [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]]
- [[👁️ Samson]] cryptically directs them: "The observatory seeks eyes. You have eyes. Strange coincidence, yes?"
- City guard captain suggests work: "Better than most jobs available."

→ Proceed to [[#Meeting the Academy]]

### Path D: Desperate Circumstances

**Party Is Broke/Needs Work:**

Bartram: *"Look, I'm not supposed to say this, but university's desperate. Lost two research teams already—one didn't come back, other came back... wrong. Pay's good because it's dangerous. But you look capable. Probably."*

**This Adds Tension:** Party knows it's risky going in

→ Proceed to [[#Meeting the Academy]]

---

## Investigate First

**If Party Asks Around Before Accepting:**

### At [[🍺 The Wanderers Rest]] (DC 10 Persuasion to chat up patrons)

**Roll 1d6 for Rumor:**
1. "Dr. Voss was fired from university for heresy. [[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] hates her."
2. "Previous research team came back changed. One student babbles about colors that don't exist."
3. "Empirical Academy doing good work. Someone needs to study this corruption."
4. "Heard they pay well because it's dangerous. Real dangerous."
5. "My cousin works there. Says Dr. Voss is brilliant but works people too hard."
6. "[[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] watches anyone who works with the Academy. Careful."

### At [[🛒 Scholars Market]] (DC 12 Investigation)

**Merchants Share:**
- Academic supplies sold to Empirical Academy at discount (they do good work)
- Recent uptick in medical supplies purchased (casualties?)
- [[🔧 Professor Magnus Gearwright]] bought odd components (unstable equipment?)

### At [[⛪ Temple of Learning]] (Father Tobias)

*"Dr. Voss means well. She seeks truth through science. I respect that, though [[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] doesn't. Be careful—helping her makes you heretics by association. But someone must seek answers."*

**After Investigation:**
Party has context about risks and politics → [[#Meeting the Academy]]

---

## Negotiate Terms

**If Party Wants Better Deal:**

Go to [[#Meeting the Academy]] but during briefing:

**Party:** "200gp seems low for the risks involved..."

**[[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]] Response:**
- Persuasion DC 13: Increase to 250gp each
- Persuasion DC 16: 300gp each
- Persuasion DC 20: 300gp + magical equipment bonus

**She'll Negotiate If:**
- Party has relevant experience
- Party brings unique skills (arcane knowledge, survival expertise)
- Party mentions hearing about previous failed teams

**She Won't Budge If:**
- Party seems greedy without justification
- Party threatens to walk away (she calls bluff: "Then don't take the job.")

→ Proceed to [[#The Briefing]]

---

## Decline and Find Other Work

**Alternative Hooks If Party Refuses:**

1. **[[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] Recruitment:** Hunt heretics, 150gp but strict rules
2. **[[🕵️ Mama Cordelia Voss]] Job:** "Protection" work, 200gp, illegal
3. **City Guard Work:** Patrol refugee camps, 50gp, safer but boring
4. **Merchant Escort:** Guard caravan, 100gp, standard danger

**Consequence:** Campaign starts differently, Field Study becomes later quest or missed entirely

**DM Note:** Gently remind players this IS the main campaign hook. But allow choice if they're adamant.

---

## Meeting the Academy

**Location:** [[🔭 Observatory Complex]]

**NPCs Present:**
- [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]] (leads briefing)
- [[🔧 Professor Magnus Gearwright]] (provides equipment)
- [[📚 Helena Brightquill]] (takes notes, observes party)

**First Impressions Matter:**

### How Party Enters

**Professional & Respectful:**
- Dr. Voss warms to them immediately
- "Thank you for coming. Let's get started."
- Straightforward briefing → [[#The Briefing]]

**Cavalier or Cocky:**
- Dr. Voss skeptical: "Confidence is good. Overconfidence gets you killed."
- She tests them with technical questions
- Intimidation DC 14 or she refuses to hire them
- If they impress her despite cockiness, she respects it

**Nervous or Inexperienced:**
- Dr. Voss reassuring: "First expedition? That's fine. I need careful observers, not heroes."
- She explains dangers thoroughly
- Offers extra safety equipment

**Suspicious or Paranoid:**
- Dr. Voss transparent: "Yes, it's dangerous. Yes, previous teams had trouble. Here's exactly what happened..."
- Shares full details about failed expeditions
- Respect for asking hard questions

### Skill Checks During Meeting

**Insight DC 12 (vs. Dr. Voss):**
She's more worried than showing. Not about party's safety—about importance of data. Desperate for this to work.

**Insight DC 14 (vs. [[🔧 Professor Magnus Gearwright]]):**
His enthusiasm partly covers concern that equipment might fail. This is experimental tech.

**Investigation DC 13 (examining expedition map):**
Previous research teams marked. Two didn't return. One came back "changed." Notations suggest corruption worse than publicly reported.

**Arcana DC 14 (looking at detection device):**
Clever design but unstable. 30% chance of malfunction. Gearwright knows this but hasn't mentioned it.

**If Party Discovers Concerning Information:**
→ [[#Confronting the Risks]]

**If Party Doesn't Investigate:**
→ [[#The Briefing]]

---

## Confronting the Risks

**Party:** "These previous teams... what happened?"

**[[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]] Honesty Check:**

**If Party Seems Trustworthy (Persuasion DC 12):**
*"Team One disappeared in Middle Ring of [[🌀 The Maelstrom]]. No trace. Team Two returned but... one member is in [[🏥 Academy Infirmary]]. Catatonic. Speaks occasionally about 'seeing tomorrow and yesterday simultaneously.' We don't know what he experienced."*

**If Party Pushes for More (Persuasion DC 15):**
*"Team Three returned intact but quit immediately. Refused payment. Wouldn't talk about what they saw. One of them joined [[🚶 The Pilgrims]] last month. I think... I think the corruption affected them more than physically."*

**Party Reaction Options:**

**Demand More Money:**
→ [[#Negotiate Terms]] (retroactive)

**Refuse the Job:**
*Dr. Voss:* "I understand. I won't hold it against you. But people are dying. Someone must gather this data."
- Persuasion DC 14: She guilt-trips them into reconsidering
- If they still refuse: → [[#Decline and Find Other Work]]

**Ask for Better Equipment:**
*Dr. Voss:* "I'll give you what I can." 
- Each PC gets 1 [[🌀 Reality Anchor Charm]] (normally given by [[🚶 Elder Miriam]])
- +2 saves vs corruption, one-time auto-success

**Accept Despite Risks:**
*Dr. Voss:* "Thank you. Truly." (She means it)
- Gain Inspiration for accepting dangerous job
→ [[#The Briefing]]

---

## The Briefing

### The Assignment

**[[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]] Explains:**

**Mission Objectives:**
1. Travel to [[🏘️ Millhaven]] (2 days north) - collect baseline samples
2. Continue to Abandoned Riverside Outpost (1 day east) - document Level 2 corruption
3. Test experimental equipment in both locations
4. Interview any [[🚶 The Pilgrims|Pilgrims]] encountered
5. Return with data and samples (2 days south)

**Total Duration:** 6-8 days round trip

**What They Provide:**
- Covered wagon with draft horses
- 2 weeks rations, camping supplies
- Academic credentials (letters of introduction)
- 50gp advance payment per person
- Basic equipment (rope, torches, writing supplies)
- **Corruption Detection Device** (brass instrument with crystals)

**What They Want:**
- Uncorrupted baseline samples
- Corrupted samples from Level 1-2 zones
- Sketches/documentation of effects
- Equipment performance reports
- [[🚶 The Pilgrims|Pilgrim]] interviews (if encountered)
- Wildlife behavioral data
- **Survival and return** (preferably alive)

### Questions Party Might Ask

**"What exactly is corruption?"**
*Dr. Voss:* "Planar convergence causing reality breakdown. Multiple dimensions bleeding together. We're still learning."

**"Can we get corrupted?"**
*Dr. Voss:* "Exposure causes symptoms: disorientation, nausea, hallucinations. Long-term exposure causes physical transformation. You'll be fine for short expedition. Probably."

**"What if equipment fails?"**
*[[🔧 Professor Magnus Gearwright]]:* "It won't! Well, 73% certainty. If it explodes, you're in Level 3+ corruption. Definitely leave immediately."

**"Why us? Why not faculty?"**
*Dr. Voss:* "I can't risk trained researchers. You're expendable." *pause* "That came out wrong. You're capable but not irreplaceable to academic community. Also you can defend yourselves."

**"What are the [[🚶 The Pilgrims|Pilgrims]]?"**
*Dr. Voss:* "People who've adapted to corruption. Live in the zones. Some voluntary transformation. [[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] calls them heretics, but they're... survivors. We want to understand how they navigate safely."

**If No Questions:**
→ [[#Equipment Distribution]]

**If Lots of Questions:**
*Dr. Voss appreciates thoroughness. Gains +1 to future Persuasion checks with her.*
→ [[#Equipment Distribution]]

---

## Equipment Distribution

**[[🔧 Professor Magnus Gearwright]] Provides:**

### The Corruption Detection Device

*"Handheld brass instrument with crystal array. Hums near corruption. Intensity indicates level. If it sings, that's normal. If it screams, run. If it explodes... well, try to avoid that."*

**Mechanical:**
- Detects corruption within 100 feet
- Hum intensity indicates level (1-4)
- Warning 1 round before corruption surge
- 30% chance to malfunction in Level 3+

**Party Can Ask:**
- "How do we fix it if it breaks?" → *Gearwright:* "You don't. Bring it back and I'll fix it."
- "Can it detect transformed creatures?" → *Gearwright:* "Sometimes! Results inconsistent. More research needed."

### Sample Collection Kit

- 20 sealed vials (various sizes)
- Tongs for dangerous materials
- Labels and ink
- Protective gloves (mundane, not magical)
- Collection instructions

### Standard Equipment

- Rations (2 weeks)
- Camping gear (tents, bedrolls)
- 50 feet rope
- Torches (10)
- Waterskins
- First aid supplies
- Academic credentials (signed by Dean Thornwick)

### Optional: Party Requests Special Equipment

**If Party Asks for Specific Items:**

**Reasonable Requests** (weapons, tools, specific supplies):
*Gearwright:* "Of course!" Provides if in budget.

**Expensive Requests** (magic items, rare components):
*Dr. Voss:* "We're not made of money. Denied."

**Clever Requests** (items that help mission specifically):
*Both:* Impressed. Might provide or offer discount.

→ [[#Dr. Voss's Private Warning]]

---

## Dr. Voss's Private Warning

**She Pulls Party Aside Briefly:**

*"The university presents this as routine research. It isn't. We're desperate for current data. Our models are failing. People are dying because we don't understand corruption's progression. Your work might save lives. But..."*

*She hesitates.*

**Branching Path Based on Party's Earlier Attitude:**

### If Party Seemed Trustworthy

*"Be careful. The corruption zones are dangerous. Worse, other factions want this research. [[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] would call it heretical. [[🌀 Ascendant Cult]] would weaponize it. Stay focused on the work, avoid political entanglements if possible. Return safely."*

**Party learns:** Data is politically valuable

### If Party Seemed Mercenary

*"I'm being honest because I think you can handle it: this data is worth more than I'm paying you. Other factions will offer better. I'm asking—stay loyal. But I know how the world works."*

**Party learns:** Expect temptation

### If Party Seemed Naive

*"This is more dangerous than I've implied. The corruption... it changes people. Not just physically. It gets in your head. If you feel strange, leave immediately. Data isn't worth your lives or sanity."*

**Party learns:** Mental health risks

### If Party Seemed Suspicious

*"You don't trust me. Smart. But I'm being honest: this matters. More than politics. More than money. More than my career. Please—just get the data back."*

**Party learns:** She's genuinely desperate

**After Warning:**
→ [[#Departure from Thornwick]]

## Samson Encounter

**Location:** [[🏕️ Refugee Camp Alpha]] edge

**[[👁️ Samson]] sits by small fire, appears to be ordinary vagrant:**

**If Party Approaches:**

*He looks up with clouded white eyes. "Seekers. Going north. Knew you would. Saw yesterday. Also saw tomorrow. Complicated."*

**Party Can Ask Questions:**

**"What do you mean you saw us?"**
*"I see many things. Most don't listen. You're listening. Good. Means you survive. Probably."*

**"What's north of here?"**
*"Change. The Shaper dreams, and world changes. Mill turns backward. Deer speaks riddles. Trees remember things trees shouldn't remember."*

**"Can you give us useful advice?"**
*"Pack that comes in threes. Don't fight them alone. Trust the old woman with phasing hand—she guides true. Miller has sad eyes—be kind. Flour is strange but not evil. And..."* *pauses* *"Three sleep, one dreams, two wake. Choose carefully which one."*

**Party Probably Confused:**
- Insight DC 18: He's speaking prophecy, not nonsense
- Most parties won't understand until later

## Meeting Miller Thomas

**Location:** [[🏭 The Old Mill]]

**Miller Thomas** (age 55, gruff but helpful if approached respectfully)

### First Impression Matters

**If Party Is Respectful:**
*"University folks? 'Bout time someone studied this properly. Come, I'll show you the mill."*

→ [[#Miller Thomas - Cooperative]]

**If Party Is Pushy:**
*"Hold on now. This is my mill. I'll decide what you see."*
- Persuasion DC 14 to win him over
- Otherwise limited access

**If Party Is Rude:**
*"Get out."*
- Won't cooperate
- Must apologize (Persuasion DC 16)

---

## Miller Thomas - Cooperative

**He Shows Them the Mill:**

**Tour Includes:**
- Waterwheel phasing demonstration
- Millstone operation
- Strange flour samples
- His observations about corruption

**Information He Shares:**

1. "Corruption came slowly, accelerating. Started 6 months ago with shimmer on horizon. Now the mill phases every few minutes."

2. "Those who transform voluntarily fare better than those forced. Seen it with [[🚶 The Pilgrims|Pilgrims]]. They choose it, they adapt. Others... don't."

3. "[[🚶 The Pilgrims]] can navigate corruption safely. One came through last week. Woman with phasing hand. She walked right through the shimmer like it was nothing."

4. **"My wife Eliza disappeared 6 months ago."** *His voice cracks.* "Walked toward the shimmer. Never came back. Sometimes I see her at the edge. She doesn't recognize me anymore."

**Emotional Moment:**

**If Party Is Compassionate (just listen, don't push):**
He opens up more, shares deeper fears and hopes.
- Gain his trust completely
- He'll help with anything
- Offers [[🏭 The Old Mill|strange flour]] quest

**If Party Pries Insensitively:**
He shuts down: "Shouldn't have mentioned it."
- Relationship damaged
- Less cooperative

**If Party Offers Hollow Platitudes:**
He sees through it: "Save it. Actions matter, not words."

**His Quest:**
→ [[#The Strange Flour Quest]]

---

## The Strange Flour Quest

**Miller Thomas:** *"The mill produces flour that's... different. 10% of it has a shimmer. Folks who eat it report odd effects—seeing colors, hearing whispers. But it's not harmful, far as I can tell. Just strange."*

*"Could you take samples to the Academy? I need to know if it's safe. People depend on this flour for food."*

**The Quest:**
- Collect samples of strange flour
- Have [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]] analyze it
- Report findings back to Miller

**Reward:**
- Miller's gratitude
- 20gp
- Future ally in village
- Access to strange flour supply (might have uses)

**Party Options:**

**Accept Immediately:**
- Thomas grateful
- "Thank you. People are hungry enough without wondering if food is poisoning them."
→ Collect samples

**Negotiate Higher Pay:**
- Persuasion DC 12: He offers 30gp (that's all he has)
- DC 16+: He can't pay more but offers services (mill work, housing, introductions)

**Refuse:**
- Thomas disappointed but understands
- "I suppose it's not your concern."
- Slight relationship damage

**Take Samples Without Permission:**
- Theft
- If caught: Thomas furious, village hostile
- If not caught: Available option (morally gray)

## Gather Information from Sara

**Innkeeper Sara Loves to Talk:**

**Persuasion DC 10 (buy her a drink, be friendly):**

**She Shares:**
1. "Miller Thomas sees his wife at corruption edge. Poor man. Won't accept she's gone."

2. "[[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] patrol came through asking about heretical researchers. Made everyone nervous. They were armed, serious."

3. "Some folks say [[🚶 The Pilgrims]] can walk through corruption safely. Saw one guide refugees last month. Eerie how reality bent around her but she was fine."

4. "My nephew Martin went north three weeks ago. Just wanted to see the corruption. Hasn't returned. I'm worried sick."

5. "That mill produces strange flour. Some say it gives odd dreams. Others say it's fine. What choice do we have?"

**If Party Asks About Martin:**
→ [[#Sara's Missing Nephew Quest]]

**If Party Asks About Order Patrol:**
"They left yesterday, heading back to [[⚜️ Goldspire]]. But they're watching the roads. Be careful."

---

## Sara's Missing Nephew Quest

**Sara:** *"My nephew Martin, he's 22. Curious boy, always was. Three weeks ago he said he wanted to 'see the corruption up close, understand it.' I told him it was dangerous but he went anyway. Haven't heard from him since."*

*"If you see him... please tell him to come home. Or at least tell me he's alive."*

**The Truth:**
- Martin encountered [[🚶 The Pilgrims]]

1. "Old woman with phasing hand camped north of here last week. Walked through shimmer like it was nothing. [[🚶 The Pilgrims|Pilgrim]] for sure."

2. "[[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] patrol asking specifically about university researchers. Think they'll come back?"

3. "Farmer Hendricks swears he saw Miller's wife at corruption edge. Says she looked right at him but didn't see him. Like she was somewhere else."

4. "That flour from the mill tastes strange. Gave me weird dreams. Saw colors I can't describe. Not bad dreams, just... weird."

5. "Heard tell the corruption's spreading faster. My cousin in Brighthollow said their whole village evacuated two days ago."

6. "[[🌀 Ascendant Cult|Some folks]] say corruption isn't curse—it's evolution. Crazy talk if you ask me."

7. "Village elder says we should stay, adapt. Others say we should flee while we can. Don't know who's right."

**DC 18:** Miller Thomas running outside in nightshirt

**Read:**
*A loud grinding noise shatters the night. The very air seems to vibrate. From your window, you see [[🏭 The Old Mill]]—it's flickering like a candle flame. One moment solid stone, next moment translucent ghost. Miller Thomas runs from his quarters, panic on his face.*

### Party Response Options

**Option A: Investigate Immediately**
→ [[#The Mill Incident - Investigation]]

**Option B: Wait and See**
→ [[#The Mill Incident - Observation]]

- Waterwheel spinning in empty air
- Reality shimmer visible around structure
- Miller Thomas watching helplessly

**Miller Thomas:** *"It happens sometimes! Usually just a second or two but this... ten minutes now! What if it doesn't come back?!"*

**Investigation Options:**

**Option A: Use Detection Device**
- [[🔧 Professor Magnus Gearwright]]'s device screams
- Readings off the charts
- Corruption surge happening NOW

---

## The Mill Incident - Observation

**Party Watches from Distance:**

**They See:**
- Mill phasing dramatically
- Miller Thomas panicking
- Event lasts 10 minutes
- Mill returns to normal

**Investigation DC 14:**
Learn same information as Investigation option but from distance

**No Social Benefit:**
Didn't help Miller directly, no relationship boost

**But Safe:**
No risk of corruption exposure

---

## The Mill Incident - Missed Opportunity

**Party Sleeps Through It:**

**Next Morning:**
Villagers talk about incident at breakfast

**Miller Thomas:** Disappointed party didn't come help

**Consequence:**
- Missed research opportunity
- Slight relationship damage with Miller
- No mechanical penalty but less trust

---

## Day 3 Morning - Sample Collection

**Mission Objectives for the Day:**

1. Collect baseline samples (uncorrupted)
2. Collect corrupted samples (Level 1 zone)
3. Test equipment in both conditions
4. Document observations

### Timeline for Day 3

**6am-9am:** Breakfast, preparation, travel to collection sites
**9am-12pm:** Baseline sample collection → [[#Baseline Sample Collection]]
**12pm-3pm:** Lunch, travel to corruption zone
**3pm-6pm:** Corrupted sample collection → [[#Corrupted Zone Samples]]
**6pm-11pm:** Return to village, evening activities
**11pm:** Long rest

---

## Baseline Sample Collection

**Location:** Northern fields, 1 mile from village (uncorrupted area)

**Task:** Collect samples away from corruption influence

**Required Samples:**
- 3 soil samples from different locations
- 2 water samples from stream
- Plant specimens (various species)
- Sketches and descriptions of area

**Time Required:** 3-4 hours of careful work

**Skill Checks:**

**Nature DC 12:** Identify best sample locations
**Survival DC 10:** Navigate to pristine areas
**Investigation DC 13:** Proper collection technique

**This Is Routine Work:**
- No combat unless party attracts attention
- Peaceful scientific data collection
- Roleplay opportunity (what do characters talk about while working?)

**Party Can Split Up or Stay Together:**

**Split Up (Efficiency):**
- Finish faster (2 hours instead of 3)
- But risk if encounter happens

**Stay Together (Safety):**
- Takes full 3 hours
- But safer if attacked

---

## Encounter During Baseline Collection

**If Party Split Up OR Rolls Poorly on Stealth:**

**Phase Wolves Attack (CR 1 each):**

Roll 1d4+1 for number of wolves

**Tactics:**
- Use Phase Step to appear behind party
- Focus fire with Pack Tactics
- Target isolated party members if split
- Flee if 50% casualties

**After Combat:**

**Investigation DC 13:** Wolves partially phased, died quickly when attacking (couldn't maintain phase while fighting)

**Insight DC 12:** Wolves defending territory, not evil—just corrupted and territorial

**Loot:** Phase essence (glands), worth 20gp each to [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]]

**If Party Stayed Together:**
- Easier fight (tactical advantage)
- Demonstrates wisdom of not splitting

---

## Corrupted Zone Samples

**Location:** Northern edge of village, near shimmer line (Level 1 corruption)

**Corruption Effects Active:**
- Wisdom save DC 10 or disoriented (disadvantage on Perception) for 1 hour
- Wild magic: Spells have 10% chance to surge
- Time feels elastic (hard to judge duration)
- Colors slightly wrong
- Echoes delayed

**Party Approaches Shimmer Zone:**

**Read:**
*Reality looks... wrong here. Colors shift when you look away. Grass grows in spiral patterns. A tree's shadow points the wrong direction regardless of the sun's position. Your footsteps echo three seconds late. The detection device hums constantly.*

**Constitution Save DC 10:**
- Failure: Disoriented (disadvantage on next check)
- Success: Uncomfortable but functional

### Sample Collection Options

**Option A: Quick Collection (30 min)**
- Grab samples fast, minimize exposure
- DC 15 checks to get good samples
- Less corruption exposure
- Might miss interesting phenomena

**Option B: Thorough Collection (1-2 hours)**
- Careful, detailed work
- DC 12 checks (easier with time)
- More corruption exposure (additional saves)
- Better research data
- Risk of encounters

**Option C: Send One Person**
- One PC collects while others stay safe
- That PC makes all checks
- Concentrates risk on one character
- Others can assist if trouble

---

## The Changed Deer Encounter

**While Collecting Samples:**

**Read:**
*A deer stands 40 feet away in the shimmer zone. Majestic twelve-point buck. Then it turns its head. And keeps turning. 180 degrees. 270 degrees. Full circle. Its eyes meet yours from backwards-facing head. It speaks:*

*"Turn back. The trees remember what you'll become."*

*Then it flickers and is gone.*

**This Is Not Combat—This Is Horror/Atmosphere**

**Party Reaction Options:**

**Option A: Chase/Investigate**
- It's gone, can't catch it
- But can find hoofprints that phase in/out
- Investigation DC 15: Deer was real, not illusion

**Option B: Ignore and Continue**
- Wise choice
- No mechanical effect
- Just creepy

**Option C: Be Disturbed**
- Wisdom save DC 12
- Failure: Disadvantage on next ability check (shaken)
- Success: Unsettled but functional

**Option D: Try to Understand**
- Arcana DC 14: Speech was dimensional overlap—deer picked up thoughts from other plane
- Insight DC 16: Warning was genuine, not threat

**Purpose of Scene:**
- Establish cosmic horror tone
- Show corruption affects minds, not just bodies
- Make players uncomfortable (in good way)
- Foreshadow that transformation isn't always physical

---

## Return to Millhaven

**Evening (6pm):**

**Party Returns with Samples:**

**Village Reaction:**

**If Party Helped Miller/Village:**

## Miller Thomas Conversation

**If Party Collected Strange Flour:**

Miller Thomas: *"Thank you for taking those samples. I know it's not your primary mission, but it means everything to us here. Food security is... well, it's everything when the world's falling apart."*

**He Opens Up More:**

*"You asked about my wife earlier. Eliza. We ran this mill together 30 years. She was the one who understood the machinery, the one with the head for numbers. I just did the heavy lifting."*

*"When the corruption started showing on the horizon, she was curious. Wanted to understand it. I should have stopped her that morning when she said she was going to look closer. But I didn't. And she never came back."*

**Persuasion DC 10:** He continues:

*"Sometimes at night, I see her at the shimmer's edge. She's... different. Taller somehow. Her hands phase like she's not fully here. She looks at me but doesn't know me. I call to her but she just... tilts her head like I'm a stranger."*

*"[[🚶 The Pilgrims|Pilgrims]] tell me she's alive, just changed. [[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] says she's lost, corrupted. [[🧪 Empirical Academy|Academy]] would want to study her. I just want my wife back."*

**Party Can Respond:**

**Compassionate Response:**
- Just listen, don't offer false hope
- He appreciates being heard
- "Thank you for not pretending to have answers."
- Relationship deepens

**Offer to Find Her:**
- "I can't ask that of you. Too dangerous."
- If party insists: Unlocks [[#Eliza Quest]] (Session 2/3)

**Scientific Response:**
- Explain transformation theories
- He appreciates knowledge but hurts emotionally
- "So she's gone, just wearing her face."

**Religious Response:**
- Quote faith/gods/hope
- He's heard it all before
- "If gods cared, she'd be here."

---

## Sara's Tavern Evening

**Innkeeper Sara:**

**If Party Asked About Martin:**

*"Thank you for asking about my nephew. Most people just move on, you know? Life's hard enough without worrying about one foolish boy. But he's family."*

**She Shares More:**

*"Martin's mother—my sister—died when he was young. Corruption, three years ago. First wave. I raised him after that. Tried to, anyway. Stubborn boy. Adventurous. Like you lot, I suppose."*

*"He talked about the corruption like it was fascinating instead of terrifying. Wanted to understand it, not flee it. Maybe I should have listened more. Or maybe I should have locked him in the cellar."* *She smiles sadly.*

**Quest Hook Reinforced:**
If party indicates they might look for Martin (Session 2), she's grateful but worried.

*"If you find him... tell him I love him. And tell him he's an idiot. Both things can be true."*
