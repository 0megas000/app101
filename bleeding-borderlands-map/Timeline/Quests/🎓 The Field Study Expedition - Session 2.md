## Morning in Millhaven - Faction Representatives

### The Wake-Up

**After Long Rest in [[🏨 The Dusty Lantern]]:**

Mayor [[Elsa Greymantle]] knocks urgently: _"The factions know you're here. They all want to 'talk.' I can only stall them so long. Who will you see first?"_

**The Situation:**

- Each faction has a representative waiting
- Can only meaningfully meet with 2 before needing to leave
- Others will remember being snubbed
- Mayor warns: "Choose carefully - they're all watching each other"

### Path A: Meet the Vigilant Order First

**[[⚔️ Templar Marcus Bright]] - Young, earnest, armed**

_"The Academy sends you into danger with trinkets and theories. The Order offers real protection - blessed wards, proven effective against corruption. All we ask is you carry our holy symbol and report what the Academy is really doing out there."_

**Offers:**

- 2 Blessed Wards (Advantage on ONE corruption save each)
- Healing Potion per party member
- 50gp "donation" each

**Wants:**

- Wear Order symbols visibly
- Report on Academy's research
- Daily prayer (just for show is fine)

**If Accepted:**

- Gain items and Order rep +1
- [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]] will be disappointed if she finds out
- [[Curator Theron Ashwald]] (Academy rep) leaves in disgust

**If Declined:**

- Order rep -1
- Marcus warns: "The corruption takes the faithless first"

→ Choose second meeting: [[#Path B: Pragmatic Coalition]] or [[#Path C: Ascendant Cult]]

### Path B: Meet the Pragmatic Coalition First

**[[👥 Coordinator Sarah Winters]] - Exhausted, practical, direct**

_"Skip the politics. People are dying. We have three refugee families who need corruption medicine delivered to Riverside Outpost - where you're already going. Help us help them. That's all."_

**Offers:**

- Map with safe routes marked
- Contact in Riverside (if it still exists)
- Practical supplies (rope, rations, medicine)
- Future work opportunities

**Wants:**

- Deliver medicine to Riverside
- Check if outpost is still viable for refugees
- No strings attached

**If Accepted:**

- Gain supplies and Coalition rep +1
- Medicine takes 1 pack slot
- Moral weight if you fail delivery

**If Declined:**

- Coalition rep -1
- Sarah: "I hope your samples are worth their lives"

→ Choose second meeting: [[#Path A: Vigilant Order]] or [[#Path C: Ascendant Cult]]

### Path C: Meet the Ascendant Cult First

**[[🌀 Brother Felix the Willing]] - Serene, unsettling, transformed**

_Shows arms with scales/crystals: "The Academy fears what they don't understand. We've learned to swim in the new reality. I can teach you to recognize true corruption from mere... growing pains."_

**Offers:**

- Corruption Identification Training (Advantage on corruption knowledge checks)
- Vial of "Adaptation Elixir" (mysterious effects)
- Warning about specific danger ahead
- Introduction to Pilgrim guide

**Wants:**

- Open minds about transformation
- Don't destroy corrupted samples

**If Accepted:**

- Learn disturbing truths about corruption

**If Declined:**

- Cult rep -1
- Felix: "The tide rises regardless of your fear"

→ Choose second meeting: [[#Path A: Vigilant Order]] or [[#Path B: Pragmatic Coalition]]

### Path D: Refuse All Meetings

**Tell Mayor: "We're here for science, not politics"**

_Elsa nods grimly: "Bold. Or foolish. The factions have long memories."_

**Consequences:**

- All faction rep -1
- No bonus equipment
- Mayor respects your integrity
- Faster departure (avoid complications)

→ Proceed to [[#The Pilgrim Proposition]]

---

## The Pilgrim Proposition

### Leaving Millhaven

**As party prepares to depart:**

A figure emerges from shadows - pale, trembling slightly, eyes that see too much. A [[🚶 Pilgrim]].

_Whispers: "The between-spaces sing louder today. You go toward the song, yes? I can show you the safe patterns. The price is... memory. One memory from each. Happy ones taste better."_

### Path A: Accept the Pilgrim Guide

**[[Whisper-of-Void]] joins temporarily**

_Performs ritual - each PC describes a happy memory that fades_

**Benefits:**

- Automatic success on navigation in corruption
- Warns of immediate dangers
- Knows hidden caches and safe spots
- Can interpret corruption phenomena

**Costs:**

- Each PC loses one happy memory (RP opportunity)
- -1 to one CHA check later (lost confidence)
- Unsettling presence disturbs rest
- Other NPCs react with fear/disgust

**The Pilgrim's Knowledge:** _"The Academy device... it shows only surface. Like counting waves, ignoring ocean. I will show you the deep patterns."_

→ Proceed to [[#Journey to Corruption Zone - Guided Route]]

### Path B: Decline the Pilgrim

_Whisper-of-Void tilts head: "The proud walk alone into hungry spaces. I will watch your patterns from the between. Perhaps we trade later... if you remain yourself."_

**Consequences:**

- Navigation checks required
- No early warnings
- Miss hidden opportunities
- Pilgrim may appear later at worse time

**Party Notices:**

- Pilgrim doesn't truly leave
- Glimpses of pale figure following
- Feeling of being watched
- Animals grow nervous

→ Proceed to [[#Journey to Corruption Zone - Unguided Route]]

### Path C: Hostile to Pilgrim

**If party threatens or attacks:**

_Pilgrim doesn't fight - simply phases partially out of reality_

_"Violence in the between-spaces echoes. Echoes draw attention. You have chosen poorly."_

**Consequences:**

- Corruption encounters increase
- Disadvantage on first corruption save
- Something is now aware of party
- Nightmares tonight

→ Proceed to [[#Journey to Corruption Zone - Hunted Route]]

---

## Journey to Corruption Zone - Route Choice

### Guided Route (With Pilgrim)

**Travel Time: 6 hours**

_Whisper-of-Void leads through seemingly random path:_

- Through dead orchards where fruit grows backward into flowers
- Around hills that exist only from certain angles
- Past a merchant wagon frozen mid-journey, occupants missing

**Pilgrim Warnings:**

1. _"Don't touch the butterfly swarm - they fly in yesterday"_
2. _"Close eyes when passing the mirror-tree"_
3. _"The ground here remembers different gravity"_

**Encounters:**

→ After resolving, proceed to [[#First Corruption Exposure]]

### Hunted Route (Angered Pilgrim)

**Travel Time: 10 hours**

_The landscape actively resists your passage_
