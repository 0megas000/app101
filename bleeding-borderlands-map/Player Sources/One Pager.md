# The Bleeding Borderlands - Player Knowledge

## The Land Where Reality Weeps
Once the jewel of three kingdoms' trade, the Bleeding Borderlands earned their name when reality itself began to hemorrhage. Picture fertile valleys where merchant caravans once carried silk and spices along the great Circle Road, ancient stone circles where druids predicted harvests, and bustling market towns where three cultures mingled in peace. 

Now? Colors exist that have no names. Gravity forgets its purpose. Yesterday's road leads to tomorrow's ruin. The very air shimmers with otherworldly energy as multiple planes of existence bleed through wounds in reality itself. What was once the safest, most prosperous region in the known world has become a realm where the impossible is mundane and the mundane is terrifying.

*The locals say if you listen carefully at dawn, you can still hear the echo of merchant bells from the time before—ghostly reminders of what was lost.*

## The Crisis
• **The Maelstrom**: 32-mile chaos zone at region's center where reality breaks down  
• **The Corruption**: Spreads 200-300 feet/month, sometimes surges miles in a day  
• **The Bleeding**: Multiple planes of reality merging into our world  
• **The Refugees**: 420,000 fled from 500,000 original population  

## The Five Cities (Connected by the Circle Road)
• **Thornwick Academy** - University city, your starting location (Northwest, 38 miles from Maelstrom)  
• **Goldspire** - Wealthy fortress city (Northeast, 41 miles)  
• **Ironhold** - Mountain stronghold (Southeast, 44 miles)  
• **Crossroads End** - Chaotic trade hub (Southwest, 39 miles)  
• **Haven's Rest** - River port managing refugees (Southwest, 35 miles)  

## The Factions (Each claims to have the solution)
• **Empirical Academy** - *"All must be known"* - Scientific research at Thornwick  
• **Vigilant Order** - *"For the order!"* - Religious authority with wealth and armies  
• **Ascendant Cult** - *"We will become the new"* - Embraces corruption as evolution  
• **Pragmatic Coalition** - *"For the greater good"* - Manages refugees, makes hard choices  
• **The Pilgrims** - Silent outcasts who are born with an illness that lets them walk in corrupted zones but weaken outside.  

## Common Knowledge
• **Before**: Prosperous trade region where three kingdoms met peacefully  
• **The Change**: Started 2-3 years ago with reality "glitches" that spread  
• **Corruption Effects**: Nausea, visions, eventual transformation or death  
• **Pilgrims**: Normal people transformed by surviving in corruption zones  
• **Resources**: Scarce but available - food from the west, some magical crafting remains  
• **Travel**: Takes twice as long near corruption, roads phase in and out  

## From the Old Records
*"In the year of the Triple Crown Summit, the three kingdoms declared the Borderlands a neutral zone of perpetual trade. The ancient stone circles, already old when our grandfathers were young, would mark the boundaries. For eight hundred years, no army crossed the Circle Road in anger. Thornwick monks kept the histories. Goldspire merchants grew fat with coin. The mountain folk of Ironhold brought metals and gems. All prospered under the Eternal Trade Compact."*

*Notable: The stone circles mentioned still exist, though some now lead to entirely different places than they used to.*

• Evolution - the world changing to something new

## Life in Thornwick
• **University Quarter**: Marble halls, Great Library, ongoing research  
• **Refugee Camps**: Northern outskirts, conditions vary wildly  
• **Daily Reality**: Faction recruiters, resource shortages, corruption scares

## Your Character
You've been recruited by the Empirical Academy for a research expedition into corruption zones. Previous teams have had "mixed results." Pay is good because the work is dangerous.

**Consider:**  
• Why did you accept this job?  
• What do you think of each faction?  
• Have you lost anything to the corruption?  
• Do you trust the Pilgrims?
