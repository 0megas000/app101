# D&D 5e Quick Character Guide


## Character Creation for Bleeding Borderlands

### 1. Choose Your Connection to the Crisis
• **Local**: You've watched your homeland slowly corrupt  
- Can choose faction/area to be from along with job etc.
• **Refugee**: You fled when corruption consumed your home  
• **Outsider**: You came to study/profit from/help with the crisis  
• **Academic**: You're connected to Thornwick University  

### 2. Consider Your Faction Opinions
Think about how your character views each faction:
• **Empirical Academy**: Smart? Naive? Hope for the future?  
• **Vigilant Order**: Protectors? Oppressors? Necessary?  
• **Ascendant Cult**: Mad? Visionary? Terrifying?  
• **Pragmatic Coalition**: Realistic? Cold? Heroic?  
• **The Pilgrims**: Cursed? Blessed? Useful tools?  

### 3. Create a Personal Stakes
What does your character want?
• Find a missing loved one lost to corruption  
• Discover what's really causing the reality bleeding  
• Profit from the chaos while you can  
• Prove/disprove a theory about the crisis  
• Protect what remains of the old world  
• Embrace the change and evolve  

### 4. Simple Backstory Formula
"I am a [BACKGROUND] who was [WHAT YOU WERE DOING WHEN THE CRISIS HIT]. When the corruption began spreading, I [YOUR RESPONSE]. Now I [CURRENT SITUATION] because [YOUR MOTIVATION]."

*Example: "I am a merchant who was running caravans on the Circle Road. When the corruption began spreading, I lost everything when my hometown vanished overnight. Now I work with the Academy because I need answers about what took my family."*

## Basic Gameplay Tips

### How D&D Works
1. **GM describes** the situation
2. **You say** what you want to do
3. **GM asks** for a roll if outcome is uncertain
4. **Roll d20** + relevant modifier vs. Difficulty Class (DC)
5. **GM narrates** the result

### New Player Tips
1. **Ask Questions** - No question is stupid  
2. **Describe Intent** - Say what you want to achieve, GM will tell you how  
3. **Think Like Your Character** - What would THEY do, not the "best" move  
4. **Take Notes** - Names, places, and clues matter in this campaign  
5. **Work Together** - D&D is cooperative, not competitive  
6. **Embrace Failure** - Failed rolls create the best stories  
7. **Speak Up** - If confused or uncomfortable, say so  

### Bleeding Borderlands Specific
• **Corruption is Dangerous** - Don't be a hero in corrupted zones  
• **Factions Matter** - Your choices affect who helps/hinders you  
• **Information is Currency** - Knowledge about corruption is valuable  
• **Trust is Complicated** - No faction is purely good or evil  
• **NPCs Remember** - How you treat people has consequences  
• **Mystery Matters** - Pay attention to clues and strange events  

### Quick Rules Reference
• **Advantage**: Roll 2d20, use higher  
• **Disadvantage**: Roll 2d20, use lower  
• **Difficulty Classes**: Easy 10, Medium 15, Hard 20  
• **Criticals**: Natural 20 always hits (attacks), Natural 1 always misses  
• **Death**: 0 HP = unconscious, fail 3 death saves = dead  
• **Rest**: Short Rest (1 hour), Long Rest (8 hours)  

*Remember: The goal is to tell a collaborative story. Rules exist to facilitate fun, not restrict it. When in doubt, describe what you want to do and let the GM guide you through the mechanics.*
