# Pilgrim (Character Trait)

*A trait for characters adapted to corruption zones*

---

## Overview

You are a **Pilgrim**—one of the corruption-adapted peoples who can survive and even thrive in areas where reality bleeds between planes. Whether born in the threshold zones or transformed through exposure, your body and mind have fundamentally changed to exist in spaces that would kill normal humans.

This trait can be taken by any race or class at character creation (with DM approval) or gained during play through significant corruption exposure and adaptation.

## Pilgrim Features

### **Core Traits** (All Levels)

#### **Dimensional Adaptation**
You have adapted to exist in corrupted reality. You gain the following benefits:

- **Corruption Immunity:** You cannot gain corruption points from environmental exposure to corrupted zones. You automatically succeed on saving throws against ambient corruption effects that don't deal direct damage.

- **Planar Sight:** You can perceive creatures and objects that exist partially in other planes of existence. You can see invisible creatures that are phased between dimensions (such as ethereal or phase-shifted creatures) as translucent, shimmering forms.

- **Reality Navigation:** While in a corrupted zone, you have advantage on all saving throws against effects originating from that zone, and you ignore difficult terrain caused by dimensional instability.

#### **Reality Dependence** (Drawback)
Your adaptation comes with a cost. While in areas of **completely stable, non-corrupted reality**, you suffer the following penalties:

- You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks as the world feels "muted" or "quiet" to your adapted senses.
- Disadvantage on saving throws while in non-corrupted areas.
- Worse effects from regular difficult terrain 
- Your speed is reduced by 5 feet as your body struggles in overly stable reality.

*DM Note: "Non-corrupted reality" means areas with 0% corruption. Areas with even minor dimensional instability don't trigger this penalty.*

### **Level-Based Progression**

As you adventure and grow stronger, your connection to corrupted reality deepens.

#### **3rd Level: Threshold Walker**
You gain the following benefits:

- **Zone Sense:** As an action, you can sense the direction and approximate distance to the nearest significant corruption zone within 1 mile. You also intuitively know the corruption intensity level (minor, moderate, major, extreme).

- **Phase Step:** When you take the Dash action while in a corrupted zone, you briefly phase between dimensions. Until the end of your turn, you can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object, you take 1d10 force damage and are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space.

**Uses:** You can use Phase Step a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

---

#### **7th Level: Between-Worlds Resilience**  
Your adaptation strengthens further:

- **Dimensional Fortitude:** Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your level, and you gain resistance to psychic damage.

- **Corrupted Recovery:** When you finish a short rest in a corrupted zone, you can choose to roll one additional Hit Die beyond your normal limit. This extra Hit Die must be spent immediately to regain hit points.

- **Stability Tolerance:** The penalties from **Reality Dependence** no longer apply. You've learned to function normally in both corrupted and stable reality.

---

#### **11th Level: Reality Weaver**
You've mastered existence between worlds:

- **Planar Adaptation:** Choose one of the following damage types: fire, cold, lightning, or acid. You gain resistance to that damage type. This represents your body adapting to energies from other planes that bleed through corruption.

- **Dimensional Slide:** As a bonus action while in a corrupted zone, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. When you do so, you leave behind a brief shimmer of displaced reality.

**Uses:** You can use Dimensional Slide a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

---

#### **15th Level: Master of Thresholds**
You are among the most adapted Pilgrims alive:

- **Corruption Mastery:** You can now choose to gain corruption points if beneficial (such as to power certain effects or satisfy requirements). You can also suppress up to 5 corruption points on yourself, preventing their effects. These suppressed points still count toward your total but don't cause symptoms.

- **Reality Anchor:** As an action, you can designate a 30-foot radius area centered on yourself. For 10 minutes, that area is treated as either "corrupted" or "non-corrupted" reality for the purposes of your abilities and those of other Pilgrims, regardless of the area's actual state. 

**Uses:** Once per long rest.

- **Between-Worlds Body:** You can use your Phase Step feature even in non-corrupted areas, and when you do, you gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.

## Roleplaying a Pilgrim

### **Social Dynamics**
- Varies as most Pilgrims are randomly born and can be raised diffrent.
- Most traditional societies view Pilgrims as "contaminated" or "changed"
- You may face prejudice, fear, or fascination
- Other Pilgrims recognize you as kin, offering aid and community
- Religious groups may see you as blessed, cursed, or heretical

### **Physical Appearance**
Pilgrims often display subtle signs of their adaptation:
- Eyes with unusual colors or faint inner luminescence  
- Very Grey Skin that shimmers slightly in certain light
- Voice that occasionally echoes or harmonizes
- Shadows that move slightly out of sync with your body
- Temperature that feels slightly "off" to touch

These are subtle enough to hide with effort but noticeable to those who know what to look for.

### **Cultural Identity**
Pilgrims have begun developing their own culture:
- Mobile communities in threshold zones
- Unique art forms depicting multi-dimensional perception
- Guide services for travelers through corrupted areas
- "Walking between worlds" philosophy

## Integration Notes for DMs

### **Gaining This Trait During Play**
A character can become a Pilgrim through:
1. **Prolonged Exposure:** Spending significant time in corruption zones (DM's discretion, typically 30+ days with regular exposure)
2. **Transformation Event:** Surviving a critical corruption event (near-death in Maelstrom, divine intervention, etc.)
3. **Ritual Adaptation:** Undergoing a Pilgrim community ritual (requires finding and gaining trust of Pilgrim settlement)

**Transformation Process:** When gaining this trait mid-campaign, the character should experience 1d4 days of illness as their body adapts, then permanently gains the Pilgrim features appropriate to their current level.

### **Balance Considerations**
- The **Reality Dependence** drawback balances early power until 7th level
- Higher-level features provide utility and survivability but not overwhelming combat power
- Features scale with proficiency bonus to remain relevant at all tiers
- The trait is slightly stronger than a feat but weaker than multiclassing, appropriate for a core character identity

### **Corruption Zones in Your Campaign**
For this trait to be meaningful, your campaign should feature:
- Regular encounters with corrupted areas
- Meaningful differences between corrupted and stable reality
- Social dynamics around corruption adaptation
- Opportunities for Pilgrim-specific abilities to shine

## Variant: Feral Pilgrim

Some Pilgrims have adapted in more extreme, animalistic ways. Replace the 11th-level **Reality Weaver** feature with:

**Primal Adaptation:** 
- Your Dexterity or Constitution score increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22
- You gain climbing and swimming speeds equal to your walking speed
- You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made in corrupted zones

This variant represents Pilgrims who've adapted more physically than mystically.

*"We walk between worlds. The spaces others fear are our home. The transformations others resist are our nature. We are not broken—we are evolved."*

**Design Notes:** This trait is designed to work with any class or race. It provides meaningful benefits in corrupted zones while imposing early drawbacks in stable reality, creating interesting tactical decisions. The trait rewards players who engage with the campaign's corruption mechanics while remaining balanced against standard character options.
