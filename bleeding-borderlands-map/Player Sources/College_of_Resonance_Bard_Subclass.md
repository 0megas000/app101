# Bard: College of Resonance

*A bard subclass focused on perceiving and manipulating corrupted reality through music*

---

## Overview

Bards of the College of Resonance have discovered something others miss: corruption isn't just chaos—it's a symphony waiting to be conducted. Where scholars see dimensional bleeding and priests see divine punishment, you hear music. The swirling energies of corrupted reality manifest to your senses as notes, chords, and rhythms that you can read, interpret, and even rewrite.

Most members of this college are Pilgrims or those who have spent significant time in corrupted zones, though some rare individuals discover this gift through magical study or divine revelation. You are part musician, part reality-weaver, conducting the fundamental forces of dimensional instability like a maestro before an otherworldly orchestra.

## 3rd Level: The Quiet Conductor

When you join the College of Resonance at 3rd level, you learn to perceive and gently manipulate the music of corrupted reality.

### **Bonus Proficiencies**
You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don't already have it. Your understanding of corrupted reality is as much mystical as musical.

Additionally, choose one of the following:
- Proficiency with one additional musical instrument
- Proficiency in Perception
- Proficiency in Insight

### **Harmonic Sight**
You perceive corruption as music—swirling notes, chords, and rhythms visible only to you. This grants you the following benefits:

- You can sense the presence of corrupted zones within 60 feet of you, even through walls and barriers (but not lead or other planar-blocking materials).
- You automatically know the corruption intensity level of any zone you can perceive (minor, moderate, major, extreme).
- When making Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to corruption, planar phenomena, or dimensional instability, you can add your Charisma modifier to the roll in addition to your Intelligence modifier.

### **Corruption Pianissimo**
*"Let me quiet the storm..."*

You can conduct the corruption around you into a softer, gentler melody. As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. A 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point becomes suffused with calming harmonic energy for 1 minute.

While the effect lasts, the area has the following properties:

- **Quieted Corruption:** Creatures within the area have advantage on saving throws against corruption effects and effects that originate from corrupted zones.
- **Reduced Intensity:** Environmental corruption effects in the area are suppressed (DM's discretion). Corrupted terrain becomes normal terrain, reality warps pause, etc.
- **Harmonic Protection:** Creatures of your choice within the area gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) at the start of each of their turns while in the area.

**Important:** This ability does not remove corruption or heal corruption damage—it merely suppresses and quiets it temporarily.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## 6th Level: The Rising Crescendo  

At 6th level, you learn to amplify corruption's music into a weapon, and your inspiration carries the resonance of otherworldly melodies.

### **Resonant Inspiration**
When you grant a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you can choose to infuse it with resonant energy. When that creature rolls your Bardic Inspiration die, choose one of the following effects:

- **Harmonic Strike:** The creature adds your Charisma modifier to the damage of the next attack that hits before the end of their next turn.
- **Dimensional Echo:** The creature can teleport up to 10 feet immediately after rolling the die, without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Reality Ripple:** The creature can choose to impose disadvantage on the next attack roll made against them before the end of their next turn.

A creature can only have one Resonant Inspiration die at a time. Receiving a new one causes the previous one to expire.

### **Corruption Crescendo**
*"Now let's turn up the volume..."*

You can conduct corruption into a violent, overwhelming crescendo. As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Reality screams in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.

On a failed save, a creature takes psychic damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier and is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened.

Additionally, the area becomes difficult terrain until the start of your next turn as reality warps and twists.

**Scaling:** The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 3d8 at 10th level and to 4d8 at 14th level.

**Interaction with Pianissimo:** You cannot use Corruption Crescendo and Corruption Pianissimo on the same area simultaneously. If you use one where the other is active, the previous effect ends immediately.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## 14th Level: Master of Resonance

At 14th level, you have mastered the art of conducting reality itself. Corruption is no longer something that happens *to* you—it's an instrument you play.

### **Harmonic Rewrite**
As an action, you can touch a willing creature (including yourself) or an object and temporarily rewrite the fundamental resonance of its existence. Choose one of the following effects:

**Cleansing Aria** (Creature Only)
- Remove one of the following conditions from the target: charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned.
- If the target is suffering from corruption effects or mutations, you can suppress one such effect for 1 hour. The effect returns after this time unless it has been removed by other means.
- The target gains resistance to psychic damage for 1 hour.

**Protective Harmony** (Creature Only)
- The target gains immunity to the frightened condition for 1 hour.
- The target has advantage on all saving throws against corruption effects for 1 hour.
- Once during this hour, when the target would fail a saving throw, they can choose to succeed instead.

**Reality Refrain** (Object Only)
- An object weighing up to 50 pounds becomes immune to damage for 1 hour.
- You can cause the object to emit bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, or suppress any light it normally emits.
- You can change the object's appearance (as the *disguise self* spell applies to objects) for 1 hour.

**Resonant Evolution** (Creature Only, Special)
- If the target is willing and you have spent at least 10 minutes in physical contact with them, you can grant them one minor beneficial mutation that lasts for 8 hours. Work with your DM to determine the effect (examples: climbing speed equal to walking speed, darkvision 60 feet, advantage on one type of saving throw, resistance to one damage type, etc.). This should be equivalent in power to a 2nd-level spell effect.

Once you use Harmonic Rewrite, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### **Master Conductor**
Additionally, you gain the following benefits:

- **Extended Range:** The range of your Corruption Pianissimo and Corruption Crescendo features increases to 120 feet, and the radius increases to 15 feet.

- **Rapid Composition:** You can use your Corruption Pianissimo feature as a bonus action instead of an action.

- **Symphonic Mastery:** When you use your Corruption Crescendo feature, you can choose a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier to automatically succeed on their saving throws and take no damage.

## Roleplaying a Resonance Bard

### **How You Experience the World**
To you, corruption isn't just visual—it's a full sensory experience focused on sound:
- Different types of corruption have different "melodies" 
- Reality warps sound like discordant notes
- Stable reality sounds clear and pure (but also boring)
- Each location has its own unique "song"

### **Your Relationship with Music**
Your music isn't just performance—it's fundamental to how you interact with reality:
- You might hum while thinking, working through problems musically
- Combat is a dance with rhythm and tempo
- You describe things in musical terms ("that plan is *dissonant*")
- Your spellcasting involves conducting invisible symphonies

### **Social Dynamics**
- **Other Musicians:** Fascinated but often can't hear what you hear
- **Scholars:** Want to study your unique perception
- **Pilgrims:** Respect your gift, may seek your services
- **Religious Leaders:** May view you as blessed, cursed, or heretical
- **Common Folk:** Your enthusiasm about corruption is unsettling

### **Signature Moments**
- Standing calmly in a corruption zone, eyes closed, conducting
- Warning the party of danger by the "discordant note" you hear
- Getting distracted mid-conversation because you heard something interesting
- Treating deadly situations like musical challenges to overcome

## Multiclassing and Builds

### **Synergy with Pilgrim Trait**
This subclass works exceptionally well with the Pilgrim trait:
- Your abilities function better in corrupted zones where Pilgrims excel
- Planar Sight complements Harmonic Sight
- Phase Step gives you mobility to position for your area effects
- Both reward engaging with corruption rather than fleeing it

However, the College of Resonance is fully functional without the Pilgrim trait—you simply perceive corruption differently than others.

### **Recommended Stats**
**Primary:** Charisma (for save DCs and feature uses)  
**Secondary:** Dexterity (for AC and initiative) or Constitution (for concentration and survivability)  
**Tertiary:** Wisdom (for Perception to detect danger) or Intelligence (for Arcana checks)

### **Effective Multiclass Options**
- **Warlock (2-3 levels):** Eldritch Blast with Agonizing Blast gives you ranged damage while you support. Great Old One patron is thematically perfect.
- **Cleric (1 level):** Heavy armor proficiency lets you frontline conduct. Trickery or Knowledge domain fit well.
- **Sorcerer (1-3 levels):** Subtle Spell metamagic lets you cast while conducting. Aberrant Mind origin is thematic.

## Sample Character Concepts

### **The Pilgrim Prodigy**
A young Pilgrim born in the threshold zones who has never known stable reality. To them, the "music" is completely natural—they're confused why others can't hear it. Innocent, curious, and sometimes unintentionally disturbing.

**Background:** Pilgrim community (custom), Outlander, or Folk Hero  
**Personality:** Wide-eyed wonder, asks uncomfortable questions, hums constantly

### **The Transformed Scholar**
A former university musician who was caught in a corruption surge. Their mind broke but then reformed, now able to perceive reality in ways that drive most people mad. Haunted by what they've lost but fascinated by what they've gained.

**Background:** Sage, Cloistered Scholar  
**Personality:** Melancholic, obsessive about documenting their experiences, fears losing themselves further

### **The Reality Composer**
An ambitious artist who deliberately sought exposure to corruption to push their art to new heights. They succeeded but at a cost—they can never go back. Now they're creating works no one else can perceive or appreciate.

**Background:** Entertainer, Guild Artisan  
**Personality:** Driven, slightly manic, alternates between artistic brilliance and frustration that others don't understand

### **The Reluctant Conductor**
Someone who developed this gift through trauma or accident and now can't turn it off. They didn't want this power and struggle with the moral implications of manipulating reality itself. Do they have the right to rewrite the world's song?

**Background:** Haunted One, Soldier, Acolyte  
**Personality:** Conflicted, cautious, seeks guidance, questions their own actions

## Balance Notes

### **Compared to Other Bard Colleges**

**vs. College of Lore:**
- Lore gets more skills and earlier Magical Secrets (utility)
- Resonance gets battlefield control and support (tactical)
- Roughly equivalent in power, different focuses

**vs. College of Creation:**
- Creation gets item creation and animated objects (versatility)
- Resonance gets area control and corruption manipulation (specialized)  
- Resonance is more situational but stronger in its niche

**vs. College of Eloquence:**
- Eloquence gets reliable talent and powerful inspiration (consistency)
- Resonance gets area effects and reality manipulation (dramatic)
- Eloquence is more generally applicable, Resonance more campaign-specific

### **Power Budget**
- **3rd level:** Utility + moderate AoE support (comparable to other subclasses)
- **6th level:** Enhanced inspiration + AoE damage (strong but limited uses)
- **14th level:** Powerful but once per long rest (appropriate for capstone)

The subclass is **intentionally stronger in campaigns featuring corruption** as a major element, and weaker in campaigns without it. For a Bleeding Borderlands campaign, this is ideal.

*"Others run from the chaos. Others fight the transformation. But I? I hear its song, and I conduct its symphony. Reality itself is my instrument, and I play it beautifully."*  
— Aria Crescentius, Master of the College of Resonance

**Designer Notes:** This subclass is balanced for campaigns featuring corruption or planar instability as major elements. In campaigns without these themes, DM and player should discuss reflavoring the mechanics to work with different environmental hazards or magical phenomena. The core mechanical chassis (area support/control with limited uses) remains sound regardless of flavor.
