- Survival itself the challenge

### Faction Modifiers

## Creating Custom Corruption Creatures

**Template: Any Base Creature → Corruption-Touched**

1. Keep base stats
2. Add **Phase Step** (bonus action, teleport 15 feet, 1/day)
3. Add **Corruption Resistance** (advantage on saves vs. corruption)
4. Change damage type to Force or Psychic
5. Add **Reality Flicker** (disadvantage on opportunity attacks against it)

**Increase CR by +1**

**Example:**
- Base: Wolf (CR 1/4)
- Add above abilities
- Result: Phase Wolf (CR 1)

## Quick Encounter Generator

**Roll d6 for Random Encounter Type:**

1. **Bandits/Criminals** - Desperate humans
2. **Faction Forces** - Roll d6: 1-2 Order, 3-4 Coalition, 5-6 Academy
3. **Corruption Wildlife** - Animals affected by reality distortion
4. **Cult Activity** - Ascendant Cult members or recruits
5. **Transformed Creatures** - Former people, now changed
6. **Planar Entities** - Things that shouldn't be here

## Boss Fight Design Tips

**Multi-Phase Fights:**
- Phase 1: Normal combat
- Phase 2 (50% HP): Environmental change or reinforcements
- Phase 3 (25% HP): Desperate action or transformation

**Lair Actions:** Major NPCs in their bases get +1 action per round (initiative 20)

**Legendary Actions:** Major NPCs get 3/round, can interrupt players

**Minions:** Boss + 1/4 CR minions (4 per player) that die in 1 hit make fights dynamic

**Escape Clause:** Most intelligent enemies flee at 25% HP unless fanatic
