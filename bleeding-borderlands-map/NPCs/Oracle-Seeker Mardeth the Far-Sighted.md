## **DM Notes**

### **Using Mardeth:**

- She's the mysterious guide archetype
- Provides prophecy and lore when needed
- Represents Isril faction without full organization
- Moral complexity—observer who sometimes must act
- Can reveal plot information cryptically

### **Character Arc Potential:**

- **Breaking Vow:** Forced to act despite non-interference
- **Final Vision:** Prophesies her own death
- **Isril's Awakening:** Present when god wakes
- **Tragedy:** Sight reveals doom she cannot prevent
- **Sacrifice:** Uses life to help Isril wake properly

### **Roleplay Tips:**

- Speak slowly, deliberately, with weight
- Use prophetic language (symbolic, poetic)
- Show age through wisdom, not frailty
- The eyes are constant reminder of blessing/curse
- Express care through observation, not action
- Reference past events casually (centuries old)

### **Balancing Her Power:**

- Far-sight requires focus and time
- Cannot see everything simultaneously
- Prophecies are symbolic, not clear
- Vow prevents direct action
- Information she shares is limited by divine will
- Some futures are uncertain even to her
