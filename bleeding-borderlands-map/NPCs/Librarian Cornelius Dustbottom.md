## **Background**

### **Family Legacy:**

**Father: Master Librarian Aldous Dustbottom**

- Held position of Head Restricted Archives for 30 years
- Renowned scholar of dangerous and forbidden texts
- Understood better than anyone what knowledge could destroy
- Loving but distant father (married to his work)
- Only family Cornelius had (mother died in childbirth)

**The Disappearance:**

- 18 months ago, volunteered for [[🧪 Empirical Academy]] expedition
- Voss needed expert on pre-convergence binding rituals
- Aldous went to [[🌪️ The Maelstrom]] Middle Ring
- Expedition was ambushed, scattered
- Aldous never returned
- Body never found - presumed dead

**The Inheritance:**

- Cornelius promoted to Assistant Librarian at age 25
- Given keys to Restricted Archives (provisional)
- Expected to know father's systems (doesn't fully)
- **Father's Master Key Missing:** Would unlock deepest archives
- Suspected his father had it when he disappeared
- Without it, some sections remain sealed even to Cornelius

### **Growing Up in the Library:**

- Raised among books after mother's death
- Father taught him cataloging, preservation, security
- Learned to love and respect knowledge
- Also learned which books could break minds
- Understood responsibility of being gatekeeper
- Never wanted this burden but accepts it as duty

### **Current Situation:**

**The Debt:**

- Father left significant debts (unknown to Cornelius until after death)
- Owed to **Merchant-Lord [[Merchant-Lord Cassius Vale]]** for "research materials"
- 500 gold pieces - fortune for a librarian
- Vale's collectors visit monthly, "understanding" but firm
- Debt or get removed from position (Vale has influence)

**The Compromise:** Six months ago, Vale made an offer:

- "Simply provide copies of certain texts"
- "Nothing too dangerous, just... valuable information"
- "Debt will be forgiven over time"
- Cornelius knew it was wrong but saw no other option

**The Operation:**

- Cornelius copies restricted texts after hours
- Uses special paper that doesn't trigger wards
- Delivers copies to Vale's agents in [[🛒 Scholar's Market]]
- So far: 23 texts copied and sold
- Hasn't noticed that some buyers are [[🌀 Ascendant Cult]] agents
- Doesn't know some texts are reaching [[👁️ Divine Awakeners]]
- Guilt eating him alive

## **Role at The Great Library**

### **Official Duties:**

**Restricted Archives Management:**

- Control access to dangerous texts (levels 4-7 restriction)
- Evaluate research requests for approval
- Monitor scholars reading restricted materials
- Maintain security wards and locks
- Report suspicious research interests
- Catalog new acquisitions

**General Library Support:**

- Assist Head Librarian with administration
- Train new library assistants
- Lead tours for important visitors
- Emergency response for book-related incidents
- Liaison with [[🧪 Empirical Academy]] research needs

### **The Restricted Archives:**

**What's Stored There:**

- Pre-convergence binding rituals
- Texts on communicating with sleeping gods
- Reality manipulation theories
- Dangerous magical research
- Corrupted or corruption-causing texts
- Books that drove previous readers insane
- Knowledge that could destabilize reality further

**Security Levels:**

- **Level 4:** Requires faculty approval
- **Level 5:** Requires department head approval
- **Level 6:** Requires [[Dean Aldric Thornwick]] approval
- **Level 7:** Requires Cornelius + Dean + armed guard present
- **Level 8 (Sealed):** Requires father's master key (missing)

**What Level 8 Contains:** Cornelius doesn't fully know - father never told him everything. Suspects:

- Direct god-summoning rituals
- Reality-ending knowledge
- Pre-god civilization texts
- Original Maelstrom cause information
- Father's personal research notes

## **The Secret Operation**

### **How It Works:**

**Step 1 - The Request:** Vale's agent approaches with "shopping list"

- Usually 2-3 texts per month
- Titles are specific, someone knows what they want
- Cornelius receives list at dead drop in market

**Step 2 - The Copy:**

- Works late night when library empty
- Uses specialized paper (Vale provides) that bypasses wards
- Perfect transcription (his one actual skill serving evil)
- Takes 4-8 hours per text
- Stress is destroying him

**Step 3 - The Delivery:**

- Hides copies in hollowed book covers
- Leaves at market stall (pottery vendor, actually Vale's agent)
- Receives payment (goes straight to debt)
- Never sees actual buyers
- Pretends not to know where it goes

**What He's Copied So Far:**

- Texts on planar convergence mechanics
- Pre-kingdom god-binding techniques
- Reality anchor construction methods
- Corruption adaptation theories
- Communication rituals for sleeping deities
- Transformation acceleration processes
- Several others he tries not to remember

**The Buyers (Unknown to Him):**

- **[[Merchant-Lord Cassius Vale]]:** Resells to highest bidders
- **[[🌀 Ascendant Cult]]:** Using transformation texts
- **[[👁️ Divine Awakeners]]:** Using communion rituals
- **[[⚜️ Vigilant Order]]:** Ironically, buying some to prevent others from having them
- **Foreign Powers:** Interested parties from other kingdoms
- **Private Collectors:** Wealthy individuals wanting forbidden knowledge

**The Guilt:**

- Barely sleeps from nightmares
- Knows he's betraying father's legacy
- Understands people might die from this knowledge
- But debt and fear of losing position paralyze him
- Wants to confess but terrified of consequences
- Prays someone will stop him so he doesn't have to choose

## **Relationship with Dr. Voss**

### **Pure Terror:**

**Why He Fears Her:**

- Voss's reputation for ruthlessness
- Her anti-religious crusade makes her unpredictable
- She's eliminated rivals and obstacles before
- Has power to fire him or worse
- Suspects she'd consider his copying "useful" or "treason" depending on her mood
- Her eyes seem to see through people

**Interactions:**

- Cornelius stammers and sweats around her
- Rushes to fulfill her research requests
- Can't say no to anything she demands
- Lives in terror she'll discover his secret
- Suspects she knows something but is waiting

**The Complication:** Voss has been requesting many restricted texts lately:

- Some overlap with what Vale wants
- Makes Cornelius wonder if Voss is somehow connected
- Or if multiple people want same dangerous knowledge
- Terrified of being caught in crossfire

**Her View of Him:**

- "Useful but weak"
- "Like his father but without the spine"
- Sees him as temporary placeholder until better option appears
- Doesn't suspect the copying (yet)
- Would be furious if she found out

## **Relationship with Players**

### **As Gatekeeper:**

**Initial Interaction:**

- Nervous, rule-bound, says no to everything at first
- Cites regulations obsessively
- Needs "proper authorization in triplicate"
- Actually stalling while he decides if request is dangerous

**Earning Access:**

- Proper channels (dean approval) = automatic access
- Convincing him research is important and safe
- Appealing to his better nature
- Proving you respect dangerous knowledge
- NOT threatening or intimidating (makes him shut down)

**What He Can Provide:**

- Access to restricted texts (with approval)
- Knowledge about library contents
- Historical research assistance
- Warnings about which books are genuinely dangerous
- Book recommendations for safe alternatives
- Translation help with ancient languages

### **The Confession Opportunity:**

If players are kind, understanding, non-judgmental:

- Cornelius might break down and confess
- Desperately wants someone to help him escape this
- Needs allies to protect him from Vale
- Could provide information about buyers
- Might help investigate what's happening to copied texts

**If Players Threaten or Judge Harshly:**

- Shuts down completely
- Flees or reports them
- Continues operation in increased fear
- Becomes long-term problem

## **Daily Routine**

**Morning (7 AM - 12 PM):**

- Open library, check for break-ins
- Morning anxiety about being discovered
- Process access requests
- Assist researchers with safe texts
- Avoid Voss if possible

**Afternoon (12 PM - 6 PM):**

- Cataloging and preservation work
- Supervise restricted reading rooms
- Administrative paperwork
- Check dead drop for new "requests" (with dread)
- Try to eat lunch (usually can't)

**Evening (6 PM - 10 PM):**

- Close library to public
- Final checks and security
- If no copying scheduled: goes home
- If copying scheduled: waits for building to empty

**Night (Copying Nights):**

- 10 PM - 2 AM: Transcription work
- Hands shaking, jumping at every sound
- Crying quietly while working
- Praying nobody discovers him
- Hating himself with every word copied

**At Home:**

- Tiny apartment near library
- Can't afford better on salary
- Surrounded by books (comfort and curse)
- Stares at father's broken pocket watch
- Dreams of finding father and being free

## **Quirks & Habits**

- **Key Jingling:** Constantly touches the keyring when nervous (always)
- **Glass Adjustment:** Pushes up glasses every 30 seconds
- **Book Touching:** Runs fingers along spines for comfort
- **Whisper-Reading:** Mouths words when reading, unconscious habit
- **Tea Obsession:** Drinks 8+ cups daily, always cold before he finishes
- **Apologizes:** Says "sorry" reflexively for everything
- **Pocket Watch:** Checks father's broken watch, knows it doesn't work
- **Dust Brush:** Constantly brushing dust off books and self

## **Secrets & Complications**

### **Father's Survival Theory:**

Cornelius suspects his father might be alive:

- No body ever found
- Father knew corruption survival techniques
- Some personal effects missing from expedition gear
- Strange "feeling" Cornelius can't explain
- Recurring dream where father calls for help

**The Hope:** If father is alive and found:

- Has the master key to deepest archives
- Could clear the debt (probably)
- Would know how to fix everything
- Could protect Cornelius from consequences
- Might contain knowledge critical to stopping Maelstrom

**The Quest Hook:** Evidence might exist that father survived, transformed, joined [[🚶 The Pilgrims]] or is trapped somewhere in corruption zones.

### **The Growing Danger:**

Texts Cornelius copied are being used:

- [[🌀 Ascendant Cult]] accelerating transformation rituals
- [[👁️ Divine Awakeners]] attempting communion ceremonies
- Some knowledge spreading to dangerous individuals
- Consequences coming back to haunt library
- Eventually will trace back to source

### **The Master Key:**

Father's key unlocks Level 8 archives, which supposedly contain:

- Ultimate truth about the three gods
- How they were originally bound
- Why the Maelstrom actually happened
- Possible solution to entire crisis
- Knowledge that could save or doom everyone

## **What He Knows**

### **Library Contents:**

- Location of virtually every text
- Which books are actually dangerous vs. overly restricted
- Hidden or mislabeled texts
- Gaps in collection (telling absences)
- Father's research interests before disappearance

### **Forbidden Knowledge (Professional):**

- How to safely handle corrupted texts
- Symptoms of knowledge-induced madness
- Which research topics lead to darkness
- Security measures and their weaknesses
- How to bypass certain wards (dangerous knowledge)

### **The Operation:**

- How Vale's network operates
- Dead drop locations
- Some buyer identities (suspected)
- Which texts are most sought-after
- Pattern of requests (someone coordinating)

### **Academy Politics:**

- Which faculty request restricted materials
- Voss's research interests
- Suspicious patterns in research requests
- Who's been denied access and held grudges
- Underground knowledge market existence

## **Goals & Motivations**

### **Primary Goal:**

**Escape the debt and stop copying texts.** Wants out desperately but sees no safe path. Trapped between Vale's threats and fear of exposure.

### **Secondary Goals:**

- Find evidence of father's fate
- Protect dangerous knowledge from misuse
- Prove worthy of father's legacy
- Eventually access Level 8 archives
- Maybe, someday, actually sleep well

### **Secret Hope:**

Someone will discover what he's doing, but instead of punishing him, will help him stop Vale, clear the debt, and undo the damage. Knows this is fantasy but prays for it anyway.

## **Plot Hooks**

1. **Research Request:** Players need restricted text, Cornelius is gatekeeper
2. **Suspicious Behavior:** Players notice him acting nervous, copying something
3. **Confession:** Breaks down and tells players about the operation
4. **Vale's Pressure:** Players witness debt collector threatening him
5. **Father's Clue:** Found evidence Aldous might be alive in [[🚶 The Pilgrims]]
6. **Dangerous Sale:** Text Cornelius copied being used for terrible purpose
7. **Voss's Suspicion:** She's investigating, Cornelius needs alibi
8. **Master Key Quest:** Finding father is key to unlocking Level 8 archives
9. **Moral Choice:** Do players help, expose, or exploit him?
10. **The Buyer:** Players discover who's really buying the texts

## **DM Notes**

### **Using Cornelius:**

- He's the "desperate good person doing bad things" archetype
- Opportunity for players to help someone truly in need
- Moral complexity—he's wrong but sympathetic
- Gateway to restricted knowledge access
- Connection to father's disappearance questline

### **Character Arc Potential:**

- **Redemption:** Players help him escape and stop operation
- **Tragedy:** Exposure destroys him and library position
- **Corruption:** Keeps copying, becomes willing participant
- **Heroism:** Stands up to Vale, faces consequences bravely
- **Discovery:** Finding father changes everything

### **Father's Return:**

If/when players find Aldous Dustbottom:

- Might be [[🚶 Pilgrims]] member (transformed but alive)
- Could have master key still
- May have crucial knowledge about Maelstrom
- Reunion with Cornelius = major emotional moment
- Opens Level 8 archives for campaign climax

### **Roleplay Tips:**

- Stammer and fidget constantly
- Make eye contact briefly then look away
- Touch keys unconsciously when stressed
- Show visible relief when people are kind
- Break down crying if shown genuine compassion
- Voice cracks when lying or very afraid

### **The Operation Consequences:**

Eventually, the copied texts will cause problems:

- Cult ritual using his transcription
- Divine Awakeners attempting summoning
- Someone goes mad from knowledge he provided
- Trail leads back to library
- Cornelius must face what he's enabled
