# 🔧 Captain Marcus Steelwright

**Title:** Chief Military Engineer, Co-Leader Pragmatic Coalition  
**Faction:** [[🛡️ Pragmatic Coalition]] (Co-Founder)  
**Location:** [[⚓ Havens Rest]], [[🔨 Engineering Works]]  
**Age:** 45 | **Race:** Human | **Pronouns:** He/Him  
**Class:** Fighter 10/Artificer 5

## Quick Reference

**Role:** Quest giver, faction co-leader, practical antagonist to academics  
**Alignment:** Lawful Good (prioritizes immediate action)  
**Voice:** Gruff, military-direct, no patience for theory  
**Appearance:** Scarred ex-soldier, always covered in sawdust and blueprint ink

## Appearance

Broad-shouldered man in his mid-forties with weathered face and gray-shot beard. Missing his left ear (corruption incident). Hands calloused from physical work, covered in old scars and recent sawdust. Wears practical work clothes—leather apron over simple tunic, tool belt always on hip.

**Distinctive Features:**
- Left ear missing (clean scar, not gruesome)
- Walks with slight limp (old war injury)
- Always smells of sawdust and metal
- Carries compass and measuring tools everywhere
- Fingers stained with blueprint ink

## Personality

**Practical to a Fault:** Every problem has solution—usually involving building something. Impatient with theory when people are dying. "Build the wall first, study why it works later."

**Former Military:** 20 years as army engineer. Builds bridges, fortifications, siege equipment. Retired to civilian life just before crisis. Pressed back into service by necessity.

**Conflict with [[🛡️ Chancellor Mira Ashford]]:** She wants long-term solutions through research. He wants immediate action through engineering. Both right, constant tension. Respect each other but argue constantly.

**Heroic but Blunt:** Genuinely trying to save lives. Just thinks best way is walls, evacuations, and practical measures. Not eloquent or political—just effective.

**Hidden Guilt:** Lost entire squad to early corruption outbreak. Survivor's guilt drives obsessive work pace. Won't rest while people still dying.

**Military Career (Ages 20-40):**
- Royal Army Corps of Engineers

## Goals

**His Lost Squad** (Dead)
- 12 soldiers died building first barrier
- Visits memorial every week

- Never forgiven himself

## The Barriers (His Life's Work)

**Design Principles:**
- Modular sections (can build anywhere)
- Local materials (no complex supply chains)
- Unskilled labor (refugees can help build)
- Quick assembly (2 days per section)
- 60% effectiveness (slows, doesn't stop corruption)

**Current Projects:**
- 12 barriers around corruption zones
- 3 completed, 5 under construction, 4 planned
- Each requires constant maintenance
- Never enough resources or people

**The Problem:**
- Corruption spreads faster than he can build
- Each barrier buys time but not solution
- He knows this but builds anyway
- Because what else can he do?

## Quest Hooks

**For Party:**
- **Protect Construction Crew:** Build site under attack
- **Retrieve Building Materials:** Rare component needed urgently
- **Survey New Site:** Need to know if location viable
- **Test Barrier Section:** Expose prototype to real corruption
- **Escort Engineering Team:** Dangerous route to project site

**Personal Quests:**
- [[The Lost Squad Memorial]] - Anniversary of their deaths
- [[The Barrier That Failed]] - Revisit site of original disaster
- [[The Impossible Choice]] - Save one group or another, can't save both

## Secrets

**Public (Party Can Learn):**
- Lost squad to corruption (drives him)
- Argues with Ashford constantly (obvious)
- Doesn't trust academics (transparent)
- Works 18-hour days (everyone knows)

**Private (Requires Trust):**
- Considers all his work ultimately futile
- Envies dead squad (thinks they got easy way out)
- Has nightmares every night (hasn't slept well in years)
- Loves Ashford (won't admit it, she doesn't know)

**DM Only:**
- Dying from exposure to corruption (1 year left)
- Hasn't told anyone, not even Ashford
- Plans to make final barrier his tomb
- Wants death to mean something

## Notable Quotes

**On Theory:**
*"Your research is fascinating, Doctor. But while you're studying, people are dying. Build the wall NOW, study it LATER."*

*"These barriers won't stop the corruption. But they'll slow it. Buy time. Time for evacuations. Time for solutions. Time for SOMETHING. That's all I can give."*

**To His Dead Squad:**
*"I'm still building, boys. Still trying. Maybe this one will be the one that works. Maybe this one will be enough. Maybe..."*

**On Pragmatism:**
*"You want perfect solution? Join the Academy. You want to save lives TODAY? Pick up a hammer."*

**To Party:**
*"I don't care if you're heroes or mercenaries. Can you follow instructions? Can you protect my workers? Then you're hired."*
