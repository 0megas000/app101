- Desperately wants to understand what happened
- Hopes studying corruption might honor his memory
- Overprotective of students who remind her of Marcus

### **Current Position:**

- Associate Professor—mid-rank, respected but not famous
- Assigned to lead field expeditions by [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]]
- More field experience than most faculty
- Reliable, won't cause political problems
- Expendable enough to risk in field but skilled enough to get results

## **Role at Thornwick Academy**

### **Teaching:**

- **Courses:** Geological Analysis, Field Methods, Planar Material Studies
- **Teaching Style:** Hands-on, practical, lots of field trips
- **Student Opinion:** Favorite professor—actually cares, explains well
- **Office Hours:** Always available, sometimes too available (overworks)

### **Research:**

- Studying how [[🌪️ The Maelstrom]] affects geological formations
- Documenting reality-warped stone and mineral transformations
- Collecting samples from progressively deeper corruption zones
- Analyzing dimensional boundary effects on matter
- Publishing regularly but not as headline-grabbing as Voss

### **Expedition Supervisor:**

**Responsibilities:**

- Plan field study routes and objectives
- Ensure student safety (biggest priority)
- Manage equipment and supplies
- Collect geological data and samples
- Report findings to [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]]
- Handle emergencies in the field

**Challenges:**

- Limited budget and resources
- Students poorly prepared for danger
- Pressure from Voss for results
- Personal grief affecting judgment
- Balancing safety vs. scientific necessity

## **Relationship with Dr. Elara Voss**

### **Professional Dynamic:**

- Voss is her supervisor and Academy leader
- Mira deeply respects Voss's brilliance
- Intimidated by Voss's reputation and intensity
- Nervous about disappointing such a famous scientist
- Feels like a fraud around Voss's genius

### **The Conflict:**

**Voss's Expectations:**

- Push deeper into corruption zones
- Take more risks for better data
- Prioritize science over safety
- "Students volunteered—they understand the risks"

**Mira's Concerns:**

- These are young people, not expendable
- Some risks aren't worth the data
- She's responsible if someone dies
- Marcus died because someone pushed too far

**Result:** Mira often caught between following orders and protecting students. Struggles to stand up to Voss despite disagreements.

### **Recent Tensions:**

- Voss wanted expedition to go 2 miles deeper into corruption
- Mira refused (first time ever), citing unacceptable danger
- Voss relented but made disappointment clear
- Mira terrified she'll be replaced
- But also proud she finally said no

## **Relationship with Players**

### **As Guide:**

- **Not a Boss:** Doesn't give orders, makes suggestions
- **Experienced Mentor:** Shares field knowledge generously
- **Safety Advocate:** "If it seems dangerous, it probably is. Let's be careful."
- **Resource:** Answers questions, provides equipment, interprets findings
- **Supporter:** Believes in players' potential, encourages them

### **What She Provides:**

- Geological expertise and analysis
- Field equipment (rock hammers, sample bags, measuring tools)
- Maps and route knowledge
- Emergency supplies and first aid
- Academic credentials to access resources
- Someone who actually listens to concerns

### **What She Asks:**

- Help collecting samples safely
- Protect younger/weaker students
- Report observations honestly
- Don't take unnecessary risks
- Tell her if something's wrong

### **Boundaries:**

- Won't force anyone into danger
- Can't always protect from Academy politics
- Limited authority to change assignments
- Can't always be there (other responsibilities)

## **Daily Routine**

**Morning (6 AM):**

- Wake exhausted, make too much coffee
- Review field notes from previous day
- Check on students (officially and unofficially)

**Day (8 AM - 6 PM):**

- Teach classes (tries to be present, often distracted)
- Office hours (always runs over—students need help)
- Plan expeditions and review safety protocols
- Meetings with Voss (stressful, rehearses what to say beforehand)

**Evening (6 PM - 10 PM):**

- Lab work analyzing samples
- Writing reports for Voss
- Preparing expedition materials
- Worrying about everything

**Night:**

- Struggles to sleep
- Dreams about Marcus
- Reviews safety checklists obsessively
- Writes letters to Marcus she'll never send

## **Quirks & Habits**

- **Rock Habit:** Constantly picks up and examines stones, even unconsciously
- **Nervous Fidget:** Clicks rock hammer against boot when anxious
- **Teaching Moment:** Can't resist explaining geology even in crisis ("See how that stone formation—")
- **Apologizes Too Much:** "Sorry, I just think—" "Sorry for interrupting—" "Sorry—"
- **Practical Gear:** Always has rope, pitons, chalk in pockets "just in case"
- **Food Forgetting:** Gets absorbed in work, forgets meals
- **Marcus References:** Mentions brother without realizing, then gets sad

## **Secrets & Complications**

### **Hidden Guilt:**

Marcus told her about "weird readings" at his mining site days before the Maelstrom. She was busy with tenure review, told him it was probably nothing. Believes if she'd investigated, she could have warned people, saved him.

### **The Sample:**

Found a unique stone sample near where Marcus disappeared. It shows properties that shouldn't exist—both corrupted and uncorrupted simultaneously. Hasn't told Voss because she's secretly trying to understand it herself. Hopes it's connected to Marcus somehow.

### **Voss's Real Plan:**

Suspects Voss's anti-religious agenda is becoming dangerous obsession. Worries expeditions are more about proving gods wrong than keeping people safe. Doesn't know what to do with this concern.

### **Burnout:**

Approaching mental/physical collapse from overwork and grief. Hiding exhaustion from everyone. One more major crisis might break her.

## **What She Knows**

### **Geological Expertise:**

- How corruption affects stone, soil, minerals
- Safe vs. dangerous rock formations in Maelstrom zones
- Where to find shelter, water, stable ground
- How to read terrain for hazards
- Unusual properties of reality-warped materials

### **Maelstrom Knowledge:**

- Geological data from all expedition zones
- Patterns in corruption spread
- Rock samples from various depths
- Mineral transformations that shouldn't be possible
- Evidence the Maelstrom is changing the planet's crust

### **Academy Politics:**

- Voss's increasing obsession and pressure
- Faculty tensions over expedition risks
- Budget constraints and resource competition
- Which professors can be trusted
- Student concerns and complaints

### **Personal Insight:**

- What it's like to lose someone to the Maelstrom
- Why people volunteer despite danger (desperation, hope, duty)
- Cost of scientific progress measured in lives
- Why safety sometimes matters more than discovery

## **Goals & Motivations**

### **Primary Goal:**

**Keep students alive.** No more deaths. No more Marcus-level losses. If she can't save her brother, she'll save everyone else.

### **Secondary Goals:**

- Understand what happened to Marcus (closure)
- Prove she deserves her position (insecurity)
- Advance geological understanding of corruption (scientist)
- Stand up to Voss when necessary (growth)
- Eventually take a real vacation (never happens)

### **Long-term Hope:**

If the Maelstrom is ever stopped, she wants to lead geological surveys to reclaim the land. Help rebuild. Turn tragedy into something constructive. Honor Marcus by making his death zone livable again.

## **In Combat/Crisis**

### **Fighting Style:**

- Not a warrior, but surprisingly capable
- Uses rock hammer as weapon (better than expected)
- Knows terrain advantages and how to use them
- Focuses on getting everyone out alive
- Will sacrifice herself for students without hesitation

### **Crisis Management:**

- Actually good under pressure (better than in meetings)
- Takes charge naturally when danger is physical
- Clear-headed and decisive in field emergencies
- Students trust her judgment instinctively
- Afterward, second-guesses every decision

## **Plot Hooks**

1. **The Assignment:** Mira briefs players on expedition, expresses concerns about Voss's objectives
2. **Safety Check:** Privately asks players to watch out for weaker students
3. **The Sample:** Shows players the mysterious Marcus-related stone, asks for theories
4. **Voss Conflict:** Players witness argument between Mira and Voss about safety
5. **Brother's Effects:** Found Marcus's journal in recovered belongings, doesn't know if she should read it
6. **Breakdown:** Mira reaches limit, breaks down in front of players, needs support
7. **Standing Up:** Needs players' backup to refuse dangerous Voss order
8. **Secret Research:** Asks players to help investigate her sample without telling Voss
9. **Rescue Mission:** Marcus might be alive, corrupted, in [[🚶 The Pilgrims]]—needs help finding out
10. **The Choice:** Voss demands dangerous expedition; Mira asks players to refuse with her
