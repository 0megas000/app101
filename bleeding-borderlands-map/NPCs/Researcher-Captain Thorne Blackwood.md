## **Background**

### **Military Career (30 Years):**

- Enlisted at 18 in kingdom's army
- Rose through ranks on merit and grit
- Specialized in reconnaissance and advance units
- Decorated for valor multiple times
- Led company through three major conflicts
- Reputation: brutal but effective
- Known for bringing soldiers back alive

**Command Philosophy:** "Discipline keeps you alive. Softness gets you killed. Hate me now, thank me when you survive."

### **The Injury:**

**Two Years Ago:**

- Leading military patrol near early Maelstrom expansion
- Ordered by command to investigate strange readings
- Reality distortion caught patrol in open
- Half his unit transformed or killed
- Thorne held line, organized retreat
- Took direct corruption blast saving two soldiers
- Left side of face scarred, left eye destroyed

**The Aftermath:**

- Corruption damage permanent
- Can see faint distortions with ruined eye (curse/gift)
- Medical discharge—unfit for active duty
- Offered pension and retirement
- Refused—needed purpose, needed mission

### **Joining the Academy:**

**Why Voss Recruited Him:**

- Needed someone to lead dangerous expeditions
- Required military discipline for chaotic situations
- Wanted leader who understood costs of research
- Thorne had corruption exposure experience

**Why He Accepted:**

- Can't sit idle in retirement
- Mission against Maelstrom is personal now
- Lost soldiers haunt him—wants their deaths to matter
- Voss promised he'd make a difference
- Academy lets him fight back

## **Role at Thornwick Academy**

### **Responsibilities:**

- **Primary:** Lead high-risk field expeditions into deep corruption zones
- Security chief for all Academy research operations
- Training students in survival and self-defense
- Risk assessment for expedition proposals
- Combat response coordinator

### **Expedition Focus:**

Unlike [[Professor Mira Greenvault]]'s student expeditions:

- Thorne leads **dangerous missions** into Middle Ring or worse
- Volunteer-only teams (mostly graduate students and professionals)
- Military-style operation structure
- Accept casualties as "acceptable losses"
- Push boundaries to gather critical data

### **Teaching:**

- **Course:** Hostile Environment Survival (mandatory for field researchers)
- **Teaching Style:** Boot camp instructor meets biology lab
- **Student Opinion:** Terrifying but effective—harsh, intimidating, but you learn
- **Dropout Rate:** 40% can't handle his standards
- **Graduate Opinion:** "Thank Thorne later—he kept me alive"

## **Relationship with Dr. Elara Voss**

### **Loyal to a Fault:**

**Why He Follows Her:**

- Voss gave him purpose after injury
- Shares his pragmatic view: results matter, costs are acceptable
- Respects her absolute dedication to mission
- She doesn't pity him or treat him as disabled
- Believes her anti-religious stance is rational

**Level of Loyalty:**

- Will execute any order without question
- Defends her decisions even when questionable
- Suppresses own doubts to support her
- Would die for the mission she defines
- Blind to her increasingly dangerous obsession

### **Dynamic:**

- Voss: "I need this done, whatever it takes."
- Thorne: "Consider it done."
- No debate, no pushback, total trust
- She values him as her "hammer" for hard problems
- He values her as commander who doesn't flinch

### **The Flaw:**

Thorne's absolute loyalty means he enables Voss's worst impulses. When she pushes too far, he enforces it. When expeditions become too dangerous, he finds "volunteers." When ethics are questioned, he shuts down dissent. He's making her more dangerous by never saying no.

## **Relationship with Professor Greenvault**

### **Professional Tension:**

Complete opposites in approach:

**Thorne's View:**

- "Greenvault is soft. Coddles her students."
- "If they can't handle danger, they shouldn't be in the field."
- "Her excessive caution wastes opportunities."
- "She questions orders—dangerous precedent."

**Mira's View:**

- "Blackwood treats people like expendable resources."
- "His methods work but break people psychologically."
- "Someone needs to check his extremes."
- "He's loyal to Voss's agenda, not to truth."

**Result:**

- Barely civil interactions
- Voss uses Thorne when Mira refuses dangerous orders
- Students caught between two philosophies
- Increasing faction within Academy: Team Greenvault vs Team Blackwood

## **Relationship with Players**

### **As Mission Leader:**

**First Impression:** Cold, intimidating, doesn't want to know your name because you might die.

- **Respect Nod:** Single curt nod is highest praise you'll get

## **Secrets & Hidden Depths**

### **Survivor's Guilt:**

Dreams constantly of soldiers lost in corruption blast. Remembers their names, faces, families. Wonders if he should have died instead. Drives his harsh training—trying to save everyone else now.

### **Doubts About Voss:**

Starting to wonder if her obsession is becoming dangerous. Won't admit it. Won't act on it. But the doubt exists, growing slowly like corruption itself.

### **The Transformation Fear:**

Terrified his eye injury is progressive corruption. Monitors himself daily for changes. Wonders if he's becoming something else. Considers what he'll do if transformation accelerates.

### **Buried Kindness:**

Occasionally shows unexpected mercy. Lets failing student retake exam. Donates salary to soldiers' orphans. Writes letters to families of lost researchers. Never acknowledges these actions.

## **What He Knows**

### **Military Intelligence:**

- Tactical assault and defense strategies
- How to read terrain and plan operations
- Combat leadership and unit coordination
- Security protocols and risk management
- Weaknesses in other factions' military capabilities

### **Corruption Zones:**

- Deep Middle Ring navigation
- Early Inner Ring survival techniques
- How to recognize reality distortions
- Escape routes and safe paths
- Danger signs before catastrophic events

### **Academy Operations:**

- Voss's actual research goals (some kept from others)
- Which expeditions are cover for secret objectives
- Faculty who object to methodology
- Students recruited for dangerous missions
- Resources Voss will deploy for critical data

### **Personal Knowledge:**

- What it's like to be touched by corruption
- Cost of survival when others die
- When orders should be questioned (but won't say)
- Limits of human endurance in hostile environments

## **Goals & Motivations**

### **Primary Goal:**

Complete the mission. Every mission. Whatever Voss needs done, gets done. No excuses, no failures. The work must continue.

### **Secondary Goals:**

- Train people to survive (even if methods are harsh)
- Gather intelligence to stop Maelstrom expansion
- Prove military discipline superior to academic caution
- Keep corruption from advancing further
- Maybe, eventually, accept he did his best

### **Hidden Hope:**

Dying in service to something that matters. Better death than slow corruption transformation. Better to fall in battle than fade away. Wants his death to mean something since soldiers' deaths must mean something.

## **Plot Hooks**

1. **Volunteer Mission:** Thorne recruiting for dangerous deep-zone expedition, needs capable fighters
2. **Training Hell:** Players must pass his survival course to qualify for field work
3. **Rescue Operation:** Thorne's team trapped in corruption surge, needs emergency extraction
4. **The Order:** Voss orders something questionable, Thorne enforces it, players must decide response
5. **Eye Contact:** Thorne's corruption sight reveals something others can't see—needs verification
6. **Old Enemy:** Someone from his military past appears, complicates loyalties
7. **Breaking Point:** Even Thorne has limits—what happens when he reaches them?
8. **The Truth:** Players learn about his lost soldiers, changes how they see him
9. **Voss's Plan:** Thorne knows something about Voss's secret agenda, might share if trust earned
10. **Transformation:** His corruption injury advancing—how long until he's not himself?
