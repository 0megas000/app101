## Personality

**Brilliant Administrator:** Former university administrator who treats refugee crisis like massive logistics problem. Every person is data point, every resource calculated, every decision optimized for maximum lives saved.

**Emotionally Exhausted:** Works 16-hour days for years. Shows cracks in facade. Snaps at people, then apologizes. Cares deeply but can't show it—would break down if she did.

**Ideologically Pragmatic:** Doesn't care about faith vs. science debate. Cares about results. Will work with anyone who saves lives. This flexibility strength and weakness—some see her as unprincipled.

**Conflict with [[Captain Marcus Steelwright]]:** He wants immediate action (barriers, evacuation). She wants to study and find permanent solutions. Both right, both wrong. Constant tension.

**[[Aurelius Goldmantle]]:** Ideological opposite, barely civil  
**[[Seraphina the Changed]]:** Pragmatic opposition, would negotiate if cult wasn't so dangerous

*"I don't care if you pray to gods, crystals, or your grandmother's portrait. I care if you can move 500 refugees 50 miles before winter. Everything else is noise."*
