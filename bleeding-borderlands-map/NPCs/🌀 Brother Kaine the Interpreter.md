**Class:** Warlock 14 (Fiend/GOO Patron)

## Quick Reference

**Role:** Radical antagonist, rival to [[Seraphina the Changed]], cult extremist  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil (believes Chaotic Good)  
**Voice:** Two voices simultaneously—his own and something claiming to be [[Malachar the Transformer]]  
**Appearance:** Scarred, eyes replaced by swirling voids, speaks prophecy and madness

## Personality

**Zealous Radical:** Makes [[Aurelius Goldmantle]] look moderate. Impatient with slow transformation. Every day without complete change is failure. Willing to sacrifice anything/anyone.

**Genuinely Believes:** Not cynical manipulator. Truly convinced he speaks with [[Malachar the Transformer]]. Whether he does or is mad—debatable. Either way, dangerous.

**Charismatic to Desperate:** New converts attracted to his certainty. Offers simple answers: embrace change or perish. Desperate refugees find this appealing when everything else is uncertain.

**Power Hungry:** Claims to serve Malachar but really wants power. Sees himself as god's chosen prophet. Plans to overthrow [[Seraphina the Changed]] and take cult leadership.

## Background

- Former priest of traditional faith
- Witnessed family transformed by corruption
- Snapped, tried to "save" them through prayer
- When prayer failed, tried to transform himself voluntarily
- Survived transformation, lost sanity
- Now hears voices (Malachar? Madness? Both?)

## Appearance

Covered in ritual scars that shimmer with otherworldly energy. Eyes replaced by swirling voids—literally empty sockets showing dimensional chaos. Speaks in two voices overlapping (his own, plus deeper one claiming divinity). Body flickers occasionally between states.
