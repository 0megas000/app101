# 🚶 Elder Miriam

**Title:** Senior Pilgrim Guide  
**Faction:** [[🚶 The Pilgrims]]  
**Age:** 65 | **Race:** Human (partially transformed) | **Pronouns:** She/Her  
**Location:** Nomadic (Middle Ring of [[🌀 The Maelstrom]])

## Appearance
Elderly woman with white hair and kind eyes that occasionally shift color. Left hand phases slightly (can reach through solid objects). Walks with staff that exists in multiple dimensions. Wears practical traveling clothes that never get dirty.

## Personality
**Wise Grandmother:** Patient teacher, sees potential in everyone  
**Philosophical:** Believes adaptation better than resistance  
**Non-Judgmental:** Doesn't condemn other factions' choices  
**Pragmatic Mystic:** Spiritual but grounded in reality

## Transformation
Voluntarily exposed herself to corruption 10 years ago. Gradual, controlled transformation. Now can:
- Navigate corruption zones safely
- Phase through obstacles (limited)
- Sense dimensional distortions
- Teach others to adapt

**Cost:** Losing her humanity slowly, knows she has maybe 5 years before fully transforms

## Philosophy
"The world is changing. We can resist and die, or adapt and evolve. I choose to dance with change rather than fight it."

## Services
- **Guide Services:** 50-200gp depending on danger
- **Teaching:** Shows how to navigate corruption (takes weeks)
- **Information:** Knows Maelstrom geography better than anyone
- **Mediation:** Respected by most factions (neutral)

## What She Knows
- Safe paths through Middle Ring
- [[🌀 Ascendant Cult]] locations and activities
- Transformation is reversible early (maybe)
- [[🌀 Malachar the Transformer]] dreams cause corruption
- Some people transform better than others (genetic? spiritual?)

## Relationship with Factions
**[[🌀 Ascendant Cult]]:** Disagrees with forcing transformation, but understands their view  
**[[⚜️ Vigilant Order]]:** They hunt her, she pities them  
**[[🧪 Empirical Academy]]:** Respects their curiosity, wishes they'd listen more  
**[[🛡️ Pragmatic Coalition]]:** Works with them often, appreciates practicality

## Quest Hooks
- Hire her as guide for dangerous zones
- She teaches party member to resist corruption
- Escort her to important location
- She asks party to rescue someone from cult
- Final conversation before she fully transforms

## Secret
She's training her successor ([[🌊 Wave-Walker Torin]]) because she knows her time is limited. Wants [[🚶 The Pilgrims]] to continue after she's gone.
