# 🛤️ Mayor Elspeth Copperton

**Title:** Mayor of Crossroads End  
**Location:** [[🛤️ Crossroads End]], Mayor's Hall  
**Age:** 48 | **Race:** Human | **Pronouns:** She/Her  
**Class:** Expert (Administrator)

## Quick Reference
**Role:** Powerless authority figure, tragic failure, desperate ally  
**Alignment:** Neutral Good (wants to help but can't)  
**Personality:** Overwhelmed, defeated, still trying

## Appearance
Middle-aged woman with graying hair, deep stress lines, exhausted eyes. Wears nice clothes that look slept in. Always carrying papers she's stopped reading. Speaks quickly, scattered, interrupted constantly.

## The Problem
**Title:** Mayor  
**Reality:** Has no actual power anymore

Elected 6 years ago when [[🛤️ Crossroads End]] was thriving trade hub. Now:
- City guard (50 people) can't control 14,000
- All factions ignore her authority
- Council members bribed by competing powers
- Budget depleted
- Can't even get people to listen

## Daily Struggle
Morning: Try to issue orders no one follows  
Midday: Beg factions to cooperate  
Afternoon: Deal with emergencies she can't solve  
Evening: Drink too much, cry, try again tomorrow

## What She Wants
- Real authority restored
- Factions to cooperate
- Resources to help refugees
- Someone to actually help instead of just using her city

## Useful To Party
**Can Provide:**
- Official documents (worthless but official)
- Information about all factions (knows everything)
- Desperate gratitude if they actually help
- Access to city records

**Cannot Provide:**
- Military support
- Financial backing
- Political leverage
- Safety

## Quest Hooks
- Help restore her authority
- Investigate who's bribing her council
- Mediate between factions
- Solve crisis she can't handle
- Protect her from assassination (someone wants her gone)

## Tragedy
She's good person in impossible situation. Trying her best. Failing. Watching her city burn. Can't stop it. Won't quit trying.

## If Party Helps Her
Becomes loyal ally. Provides information, safe house, political support (what little she has). Remembers kindness.
