Thin man with sharp features and cold gray eyes. Always impeccably dressed in expensive robes. Counts coins while talking. Smells of parchment and gold. Never smiles, rarely shows any emotion.

**Ruthless:** Will bankrupt competitors, bribe officials, fund assassinations  
**Pragmatic:** Not actually very religious—serves Order because it's powerful  
**Enabler:** Funds [[⚜️ Aurelius Goldmantle]]'s extremism because it consolidates power

## Secrets He Keeps
**From Aurelius:**

- Has escape plan if everything collapses (ships loaded, assets liquid)

## Combat
Not a fighter. Surrounded by guards always. If cornered:
- Tries to bribe attackers
- Calls for help
- Uses minions as shields
- Escapes via secret passages
