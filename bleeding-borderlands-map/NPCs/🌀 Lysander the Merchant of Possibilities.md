# 🌀 Lysander the Merchant of Possibilities

**Faction:** Unknown (supplies [[🌀 Ascendant Cult]])  
**Location:** Appears randomly, usually at crossroads or boundaries  
**Age:** ??? | **Race:** ??? | **Pronouns:** He/Him (probably)  
**True Nature:** Complete mystery, deeply unsettling

## Appearance
May not be entirely human anymore. Face sometimes shifts features mid-conversation. Height seems to vary (5'8" to 6'2" depending on observer). Wears hooded cloak made of material that doesn't exist—color changes based on angle, sometimes transparent, sometimes impossibly dark. Always carries merchant's pack that's bigger inside than outside.

## Personality
**Polite:** Unfailingly courteous, never threatens  
**Mysterious:** Answers questions with questions  
**Unsettling:** Something wrong you can't quite identify  
**Fair:** Keeps his bargains (but bargains are terrible)

## What He Sells
- Corrupted artifacts from deep Maelstrom
- Texts about planar convergence (ancient, shouldn't exist)
- Substances that accelerate transformation
- Information about other factions
- Maps to secret locations
- Items from other planes

**Everything has a price. Nothing costs gold.**

## The Price
Never asks for money. Wants abstract things:
- "Pay me with the year you would have lived"
- "Give me your connection to your mother's love"
- "I'll take your favorite memory"
- "The color blue belongs to me now"

People who pay don't understand consequences until later:
- Lost year: Age one year instantly
- Lost connection: Mother's face blank in memory
- Lost memory: Can't remember wedding day
- Lost color: Can't see blue anymore (looks like gray)

## What Is He?
**Theories:**
- Human transformed beyond recognition
- Entity from another plane
- Agent of [[🌀 Malachar the Transformer]]
- Demon/devil making infernal contracts
- Reality itself personified
- Merchant from the future

**Truth:** Unknown. Even [[🌀 Seraphina the Changed]] fears him.

## Encounters
**Appears When:**
- Party at crossroads making decision
- Someone desperate enough to pay any price
- Major corruption surge nearby
- Someone speaks his name three times
- At boundaries between things (dawn/dusk, life/death, order/chaos)

**What He Offers:**
Exactly what you need. But the price...

**Can You Refuse Him?**
Yes. He's polite. Never forces sales. Just offers. Waits.

## Using Lysander
**Atmosphere:** Cosmic horror, creeping dread  
**Purpose:** Temptation, Faustian bargains  
**Warning:** Don't let party trade lightly—consequences are real and permanent

## Sample Interaction
**Party:** "We need to cross the corruption zone safely."  
**Lysander:** "I have passage tokens. They will protect you completely."  
**Party:** "What's the price?"  
**Lysander:** *smiles (too many teeth)* "Your certainty that tomorrow will come. A small thing, yes?"  
**Effect:** Party member gains severe anxiety—never sure they'll wake up tomorrow.
