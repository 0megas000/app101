## The Oracle Replacement

**[[👁️ Divine Awakeners]]' Plan:**

- See all possible futures constantly

**Samson's Test:**
- Watching party for potential candidates
- Giving subtle tests they don't recognize
- Will eventually offer choice to one of them
- Or guide them to prevent his replacement
- Or let them choose replacement from NPCs

## Secrets

**GM Only:**
- Samson knows campaign's ending already (all versions)
- Can't tell players or it won't happen correctly
- Sometimes struggles not to interfere
- Every "random" appearance carefully calculated
- His entire life is performance for Isril's purpose

- Still helps [[👁️ Divine Awakeners]] because he sees it's necessary
- Willing to sacrifice himself
- But won't make it easy—tests worthiness
