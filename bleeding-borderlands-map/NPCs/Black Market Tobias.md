## **Secrets & Complications**

### **The Secret He Keeps:**

**Dr. Elara Voss's Father:** Tobias sold [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]]'s father a corrupted artifact 20 years ago—the artifact that killed him in his lab. Voss doesn't know Tobias exists, doesn't know where artifact came from. Tobias has carried guilt ever since. It's why he's careful with corrupted items now. If Voss ever found out...

### **The Succession Problem:**

Tobias is getting old. [[🕵️ Helping Hand]] wants him to train replacement. He's resisting because:

- Job is his life, identity, purpose
- Doesn't trust potential successors
- Afraid of forced retirement (syndicate euphemism for "eliminated")
- Looking for right person to pass to
- Might see potential in players?

### **The Escape Plan:**

Despite bribes and protection, has elaborate escape route:

- Multiple false identities prepared
- Caches of money and goods hidden
- Safe houses in other cities
- Contacts beyond [[🕵️ Helping Hand]] reach
- Will disappear if situation becomes untenable
- Might take favorite customers with him

### **The Artifact Collection:**

Privately collects one-of-a-kind items he can't resist:

- Small museum in secret safe house
- Magical oddities and historical pieces
- Some incredibly dangerous
- Not for sale at any price
- His legacy when he's gone

## **What He Knows**

### **Intelligence:**

- Every faction's current activities
- Who's buying what (reveals intentions)
- Location of most faction agents
- Safe routes through corruption zones

- Other syndicates and rivals
- Police and guard corruption
- Power structures in criminal world

## **Goals & Motivations**

### **Primary Goal:**

**Keep Operating:** The game is life. Making deals, solving problems, staying ahead. Retirement means death (metaphorically, maybe literally).

### **Secondary Goals:**

- Find worthy successor for operations
- Maintain [[🕵️ Helping Hand]] dominance
- Build personal legacy beyond crime
- Atone for past mistakes (especially Voss's father)
- Protect certain people he's grown fond of
- Die on his own terms, still working

### **Hidden Desire:**

Actually wants to be caught and forced to stop. Can't quit himself, but if forced? Could finally rest without shame of walking away.

## **Plot Hooks**

1. **The Introduction:** Players need something impossible, led to Tobias
2. **Information Trade:** Tobias has intel they need, wants favor in return
3. **Rival Deal:** Another faction buying through him, players must intercept
4. **Helping Hand Mission:** Syndicate needs something, Tobias recruiting
5. **Protection Job:** Someone targeting Tobias, needs temporary bodyguards
6. **The Voss Connection:** Discovery of his role in her father's death
7. **Succession Choice:** Wants player character as apprentice/successor
8. **Artifact Quest:** Rare item in his collection, might lend/sell for right price
9. **Double Cross:** Someone framing Tobias, needs help clearing name
10. **Final Job:** "One last big score" before retirement (never works that way)

## **DM Notes**

### **Using Tobias:**

- He's the "fix-it" NPC when players need impossible things
- Source of rumors and plot hooks
- Connection to criminal underworld
- Moral complexity—likeable but definitely criminal
- Can help or hinder depending on player choices

### **Character Arc Potential:**

- **Betrayal:** [[🕵️ Helping Hand]] orders him against players
- **Succession:** Training player as replacement
- **Exposure:** Voss discovers his role in father's death
- **Retirement:** Finally getting out of the game

### **Balancing His Power:**

- Yes, he can get most things, but:
    - Takes time (hours to days)
    - Costs money (expensive)
    - Might attract attention
    - Some things even he can't get
    - Price includes complications sometimes

### **Roleplay Tips:**

- Always warm and friendly surface
- Drop useful information casually
- Never threaten—just explain reality
- Tell stories while conducting business
- Remember and reference past interactions
- Show age occasionally (tired, aching)
- Hint at deeper complexity beneath charm

### **Helping Hand Integration:**

If you want to develop the syndicate:

- Can lead to meeting [[🕵️ Mama Cordelia Voss]]
- Syndicate offers alternative power structure
- Criminal questline possibilities
- Faction complication (Order vs Syndicate)
