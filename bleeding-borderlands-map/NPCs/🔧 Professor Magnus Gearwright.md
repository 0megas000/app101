## Quick Reference

**Role:** Friendly quest giver, equipment provider, comic relief, genuine genius  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Good  
**Voice:** Fast-talking, enthusiastic, tangents constantly  
**Appearance:** Diminutive gnome covered in grease, pockets full of tools, wild hair

## Personality

**Infectious Enthusiasm:** Treats every problem as exciting puzzle. Failure just means more data. Never discouraged, always optimistic.

**Brilliant Inventor:** Creates devices to detect, measure, and resist corruption. Practical where [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]] is theoretical.

**Socially Oblivious:** Forgets people need sleep, food, breaks. Works 20-hour days, assumes everyone else does too. Genuinely apologetic when reminded.

**Best Friend Status:** One of few people [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]] relaxes around. They argue constantly about theory vs. application but deep mutual respect.

## Background

- Studied at prestigious gnome engineering academy
- Came to [[Thornwick Academy]] for research position
- Developed corruption detection devices
- Blacklisted alongside [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]]
- Stayed because "this is most interesting problem ever!"

## Inventions

**Corruption Detector:** Handheld device measuring corruption levels (gives to party)  
**Protective Amulets:** Provides advantage on saves vs. corruption (limited supply)  
**Reality Anchor:** Experimental device stabilizing small areas (unreliable)  
**Phase Goggles:** See into other dimensions briefly (side effects: headaches)

## Role in Campaign

**Equipment Provider:** Creates custom items for party  
**Quest Giver:** "Test this prototype for me!" (inevitably goes wrong amusingly)  
**Information Source:** Explains corruption mechanics in practical terms  
**Comic Relief:** Inventions explode, experiments escape, chaos follows him

## Relationships

**[[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]]:** Best friend, intellectual sparring partner  
**[[Captain Marcus Steelwright]]:** Fellow engineer, collaborate on barriers  
**[[Helena Brightquill]]:** Graduate student, helps with experiments  
**[[Marcus & Sara]]:** Undergrads, apprentice artificers

## Quest Hooks

- Test experimental equipment in field
- Retrieve rare components for invention
- Rescue him from experiment gone wrong
- Install his devices in dangerous location

## Secrets

- Working on device to reverse transformation (hasn't told anyone, might not work)
- Accidentally created sentient construct (hiding it in workshop)

## Notable Quote

*"Of course it's safe! Well, 73% safe. 68%? Look, nothing's perfectly safe, but this is safer than alternative, which is not having it when you need it!"*
