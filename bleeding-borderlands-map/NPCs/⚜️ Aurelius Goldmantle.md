**First Encounter:** [[The Golden Gates]] - Party questioned entering Goldspire  
**Voice:** Deep, resonant, speaks with absolute conviction

## Appearance

Tall and imposing man in his early sixties with steel-gray hair cut military-short. Piercing blue eyes that once showed warmth now burn with cold fire. Always dressed in golden ceremonial armor that gleams even in dim light—symbols of the [[Vigilant Order]] etched into every surface. White cloak trimmed with gold thread flows behind him. Carries blessed longsword "Purifier" that has executed dozens of "heretics."

Face deeply lined with grief and determination. Strong jaw set in permanent grimace. Moves with military precision despite age. Bears himself as living embodiment of divine judgment.

**Distinctive Features:**
- Golden armor never tarnished (blessed daily)
- White streak through left side of hair (appeared after family died)
- Burn scars on left forearm (from trying to save family)
- Wedding ring on chain around neck (never removes it)

## Personality Traits

**Zealous and Uncompromising**  
Once moderate religious leader, now extremist driven by personal tragedy. No tolerance for deviation from Order doctrine. Sees compromise as weakness and weakness as sin that kills.

**Grief-Driven**  
Lost wife Elise and children Thomas (12) and Catherine (8) to early corruption outbreak. Blames himself for not being faithful enough to prevent it. Channeled grief into religious fanaticism.

**Genuinely Believes**  
Not cynical power-seeker. Truly convinced [[Vigilant Order]] represents only path to salvation. Every atrocity committed in pursuit of what he sees as greater good.

**Charismatic Leader**  
Inspires fierce loyalty in followers. Powerful orator who can move crowds to tears or fury. Genuinely cares for those who follow Order—just not for anyone else.

**Increasingly Unstable**  
Grief and pressure pushing him toward dangerous decisions. Starting to see heresy everywhere. Trust eroding even among allies. Becoming the tyrant he once would have opposed.

**Military Brilliance**  
Former banking guild leader turned religious warrior. Combines financial acumen with strategic thinking. Made [[Vigilant Order]] most powerful faction through wealth and organization.
