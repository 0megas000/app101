**Title:** Town Guard Captain, Crossroads End  
**Location:** [[🛤️ Crossroads End]], Guard Station  
**Age:** 35 | **Race:** Human | **Pronouns:** She/Her  
**Class:** Fighter 6

## Quick Reference
**Role:** Understaffed law enforcement, suspicious authority, potential ally  
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral (follows the law even when impossible)  
**Personality:** Gruff, professional, cynical about outsiders

## Appearance
Scarred veteran in dented armor. Short dark hair, permanent scowl, calloused hands. Carries longsword that's seen use. Looks perpetually exhausted.

## The Impossible Job
**50 guards** trying to police **14,200 people**  
**6 factions** operating openly  
**Criminal syndicate** more powerful than she is  
**Mayor** has no resources to give her

She tries anyway. Maintains order in small areas. Prevents total chaos. Saves who she can.

## Attitude Toward Party
**Initial:** Suspicious (are they faction agents? troublemakers? competent help?)  
**If Helpful:** Grudging respect, might deputize them  
**If Troublesome:** Arrest warrant (can't enforce it, but tries)

## What She Knows
- Every faction's movements
- [[🕵️ Mama Cordelia Voss]]'s territory
- Where bodies are buried (literally)
- Who's trustworthy (almost no one)
- City is falling apart

## What She Needs
- More guards (won't get them)
- Resources (budget gone)
- Authority (mayor powerless)
- Help from competent outsiders (desperate)

## Services
**Can Provide:**
- Official sanction to act
- Information about criminal activity
- Back-up (maybe 2-3 guards)
- Turn blind eye to party's methods if they get results

**Wants In Return:**
- Help solving impossible problems
- Don't make her job harder
- Report serious crimes
- Respect what little authority she has

## Quest Hooks
- Investigate murders in refugee camps
- Stop faction warfare before it engulfs city
- Deal with [[🕵️ Mama Cordelia Voss]] (complicated)
- Protect important visitor
- Find missing person

## Respect
She's doing her best with nothing. Holding the line. Won't surrender. Party can earn her loyalty through competence and respect.
