### ⛰️ Ironhold

**Location:** 44 miles SE from [[🌀 The Maelstrom]]  
**Population:** 16,800 (8,500 original + 8,300 refugees)  
**Elevation:** 650 feet, carved into [[⛰️ Ironspine Mountains]]  
**Controlling Faction:** Neutral (Coalition-leaning)  
**Status:** Overcrowded mountain fortress

#### Description

Ironhold burrows into the living rock of the Ironspine Mountains like a vast underground city crowned by surface structures. The Great Gate, a massive stone entrance 30 feet wide and 40 feet tall, can be sealed completely against any threat. Seven levels descend into the mountain's heart, connected by carved stairs and natural passages that echo with the sounds of hammers and voices.

The air carries the scent of forge fires, stone dust, and the crisp mountain water that flows from springs deep within the rock. Ironhold represents pragmatic survival - every space is functional, every tool has a purpose, and every person has a role in the community's defense.
