### ⚓ Haven's Rest

**Location:** 35 miles SW from [[🌀 The Maelstrom]]  
**Population:** 19,500  
**Elevation:** 380 feet along [[🌊 Silverflow River]]  
**Controlling Faction:** [[🛡️ Pragmatic Coalition]] (Headquarters)  
**Status:** Efficient crisis management center

#### Description

Haven's Rest exemplifies practical efficiency over aesthetic beauty. This river port city functions like a well-oiled machine dedicated to one purpose: managing the greatest refugee crisis in regional history. Wooden walls surround orderly districts of warehouses, processing centers, and temporary housing. The constant sound of hammer and saw mingles with barge horns and shouted orders as the city expands daily to meet growing needs.

The Silverflow River provides both transportation and power, with waterwheels driving mills and workshops. Unlike other cities struggling with the crisis, Haven's Rest has embraced its role as the logistical heart of survival operations.

## 🏰 MAJOR FORTRESSES & STRONGHOLDS

### 🌀 The Threshold Commune

**Location:** Maelstrom Inner Ring (6 miles NE of center)  
**Population:** ~300 (fluctuating)  
**Controlling Faction:** [[🌀 Ascendant Cult]] (Headquarters)  
**Status:** Extremely dangerous

#### Description

The Threshold Commune exists in a state of constant transformation, its very architecture shifting between realities as buildings phase in and out of dimensional stability. Built on a plateau that remains relatively stable within the corruption zone, the commune serves as both fortress and laboratory for those who embrace the changing world.

Reality flows like water here - walls might be solid stone one moment and translucent energy the next. The air shimmers with possibility, and inhabitants move with the fluid grace of those who have learned to exist between worlds.

**Key Locations:**

- **[[🏛️ The Shifting Halls]]** - Central building phasing between realities
- **[[🌀 Transformation Chambers]]** - Ritual spaces for voluntary corruption
- **[[🏠 Commune Housing]]** - Residential areas for cult members
- **[[🔮 Reality Anchor Plaza]]** - Only stable meeting area
- **[[⚗️ Corruption Labs]]** - Experimentation facilities
- **[[🛡️ Phasing Defenses]]** - Interdimensional barriers

**NPCs:**

- **[[Seraphina "The Changed"]]** - High Conduit, partially transformed leader
- **[[Brother Kaine the Interpreter]]** - Radical prophet claiming divine contact
- **[[Lysander the Merchant of Possibilities]]** - Mysterious supplier of artifacts

**Current Situation:** The commune prepares for a major ritual to breach quarantine barriers and accelerate corruption spread. Internal conflicts arise between gradual transformation advocates and immediate action radicals.
