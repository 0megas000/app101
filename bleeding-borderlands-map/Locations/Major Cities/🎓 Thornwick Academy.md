# Thornwick Academy

**Type:** University City | **Population:** 18,500 (12,000 permanent, 6,500 refugees)
**Faction Control:** [[🧪 Empirical Academy]]
**Distance:** 38 miles Northwest of [[🌀 The Maelstrom]]
**Elevation:** 1,200 feet across seven rolling hills

## **Overview**
Rising from rolling hills like a beacon of civilization and learning, Thornwick Academy represents the triumph of knowledge over chaos. The city spreads organically across seven hills, with the crystalline dome of [[🗼 Thornwick's Spire]] serving as both literal lighthouse and metaphorical symbol of hope. From fifteen miles away, travelers can see the spire's ethereal blue-white glow, a reassuring constant in an increasingly chaotic world.

The air carries the distinctive scent of old parchment, alchemical reagents, and that metallic tang that precedes a thunderstorm. Ancient oak trees line cobblestone streets worn smooth by centuries of student feet, their leaves whispering with an almost intelligent rustle. Architecture blends centuries of styles, from original stone foundations to hasty wooden refugee structures, creating a living timeline of crisis and adaptation.
