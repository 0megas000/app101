# Mount Thyros

**Type:** Sacred Mountain - God's Tomb | **Height:** 18,000+ feet
**Location:** Remote, far from [[🌪️ The Maelstrom]] and major settlements
**Corruption Level:** None - Too Distant
**Related God:** [[⚰️ Thyros the Ender]]
**Threat Level:** Extreme - Environmental and Guardian Hazards

## **Overview**
A towering colossus of stone and ice that dominates the horizon for a hundred miles in every direction. Mount Thyros is the highest peak in the known world, its summit perpetually shrouded in clouds that locals call "the Veil of Finality." The mountain is beautiful in its severity—sharp, unforgiving, absolute. No birds circle its peaks. No plants cling to its slopes above the tree line. Only snow, stone, and silence.

Deep within its frozen heart lies the tomb of [[⚰️ Thyros the Ender]], god of death and finality, sealed away in an ancient chamber of sacrifice and eternal rest.

## **Physical Appearance**

### **The Mountain:**
- **Massive Scale:** 18,000+ feet of sheer stone and ice
- **Sharp Profile:** Angular, intimidating silhouette against the sky
- **Eternal Snow:** Peaks white year-round, glaciers on every face
- **Black Stone:** Dark granite visible through snow, almost obsidian
- **Vertical Faces:** Sheer cliffs make climbing treacherous
- **Avalanche Prone:** Constant danger from shifting snow
- **The Summit:** Impossible to see through perpetual cloud cover

### **The Approach:**
- **Lower Slopes (0-8,000 ft):** Rocky foothills with sparse pine forests
- **Middle Mountain (8,000-14,000 ft):** Open snowfields and ice formations
- **Upper Reaches (14,000-18,000 ft):** Deadly conditions, thin air, brutal winds
- **The Tomb Entrance:** Hidden at ~12,000 feet on the northwestern face

### **Atmosphere:**
- **Oppressive Cold:** Not just temperature—cold that seeps into your soul
- **Rigid Silence:** Sound feels wrong, muffled, final
- **Sense of Doom:** Not terror, but acceptance—"this is where things end"
- **Timelessness:** Like the mountain has always been and always will be
- **Watchfulness:** Feeling of being judged for worthiness

## **The Climb**

### **Lower Slopes (Days 1-2):**
**Difficulty:** Moderate
**Hazards:**
- Loose scree and unstable rock
- Hidden crevasses under thin snow
- Sudden weather changes
- Mountain predators (bears, wolves)

**Encounters:**
- Normal wildlife avoiding the mountain
- Other expedition camps
- Warning markers from previous climbers
- Abandoned gear from failed attempts

### **Middle Mountain (Days 3-4):**
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Hazards:**
- Severe altitude effects (exhaustion, disorientation)
- Blizzard conditions with zero visibility
- Avalanche danger zones
- Crevasses hundreds of feet deep

**Encounters:**
- **Snow Giants:** 12-foot tall humanoids made of animated ice and stone
- **Ice Golems:** Smaller constructs patrolling specific areas
- Frozen corpses of previous climbers (intact, eyes open)
- Strange ice formations that seem deliberately placed

**Snow Giants & Golems:**
- Not intelligent, but purposeful
- Guard approaches to tomb entrance
- Attack anything that comes too close
- Immune to cold, resistant to physical damage
- Can summon blizzards and avalanches
- 3-5 giants patrol set routes
- 8-12 golems serve as sentries

### **Upper Reaches (Day 5+):**
**Difficulty:** Nearly Impossible
**Hazards:**
- Oxygen deprivation
- Temperatures of -40°F or lower
- Winds that can knock people off cliffs
- Flash-freezing fog that causes frostbite in seconds
- Hallucinations from altitude

**Encounters:**
- **Greater Snow Giants:** 20-foot tall patrol leaders
- Reality feels thin—death seems very close
- Visions of your own death (prophetic warnings)
- The pull to just "rest" and never wake up

## **The Tomb Entrance**

**Location:** Northwestern face, ~12,000 feet elevation
**Appearance:** Natural cave mouth, 15 feet tall, framed by icicles like teeth
**Discovery:** Easy to miss—blends with surrounding rock formations
**Markers:** Ancient runes carved into stone, faded and worn

### **The Cave System:**
**Entry Passage:** 200 feet of twisting natural tunnel, narrow and claustrophobic
**The Descent:** Spiraling pathway leads down 300 feet into the mountain's heart
**Temperature:** Somehow colder inside than outside
**Light:** None—total darkness except what you bring
**Sound:** Echoes strangely, as if space is larger than it seems

### **Guardian Undead:**
Stationed throughout the cave system, these are not mindless zombies but eternal sentinels.

**Types:**
- **Tomb Wardens (6):** Armored skeletons with ancient weapons, skilled combatants
- **Bone Knights (3):** Elite warriors in rusted full plate, devastating fighters  
- **Death Priests (2):** Robed figures channeling necrotic energy, spellcasters
- **The Keeper:** Single powerful undead guardian at tomb entrance (see below)

**Behavior:**
- Patient—will wait centuries between encounters
- Intelligent—can assess threats and tactics
- Unyielding—fight to complete destruction
- Silent—communicate only through action
- Purpose-driven—exist solely to protect tomb

**Combat Notes:**
- Coordinate attacks intelligently
- Use terrain advantage (narrow passages, ambush points)
- Necrotic damage and life drain abilities
- Resistant to non-magical weapons
- Can sense living beings entering the cave
- Do not pursue beyond cave entrance

## **The Tomb Chamber** *(Deep Inside)*

### **The Approach:**
Final passage opens into massive natural cavern, at least 200 feet across and 100 feet high. The temperature drops even further. Your breath freezes instantly. The air feels heavy with finality.

### **The Keeper:**
Before entering the main chamber, adventurers face **The Keeper**—a single undead guardian of immense power.

**Appearance:** 8-foot tall armored figure, ancient plate blackened and covered in frost. Empty eye sockets burn with pale blue fire. Carries a massive two-handed sword etched with runes of ending.

**Power Level:** Deadly encounter for even high-level parties
**Abilities:** 
- Necrotic aura that drains life
- Can summon shadows and specters
- Immune to cold, resistant to most damage
- Regenerates unless completely destroyed
- Speaks (first time any undead has): "Turn back. This is not your ending."

**The Test:** The Keeper evaluates worthiness. Those with pure intent to understand or protect (not exploit) may be allowed to pass. Those seeking power or disturbance must fight.

### **The Chamber Layout:**

**The Floor:** Perfectly circular, 150 feet diameter, carved from single piece of black stone. Surface polished mirror-smooth despite millennia.

**The Empty Tombs (24 total):**
Arranged in perfect circle around the chamber's perimeter. Each is human-sized, carved from white marble, lids open and empty—waiting for occupants who never came.

**Purpose:** Meant for ritual sacrifices to seal Thyros. The sealing was either completed differently or never completed. Evidence suggests last-minute change of plans.

**Details:**
- Names carved on each tomb (languages lost to time)
- Burial goods still present (ancient coins, weapons, jewelry)
- No bodies—never were any, or bodies removed?
- Faint magical residue suggests powerful binding ritual

**The Central Casket:**
**Size:** 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, 10 feet tall—as large as a small house
**Material:** Single piece of black stone, same as floor
**Appearance:** Perfectly rectangular, no ornamentation except single symbol on top—a circle bisected by a line (beginning and ending)
**Condition:** Sealed with what appears to be divine magic, completely intact

**Approaching the Casket:**
- Overwhelming sense of finality and peace
- All sound becomes muted to near-silence
- Time feels like it stops
- Breathing becomes difficult (not physically—existentially)
- Compulsion to simply lie down and rest forever

**Inside (If Opened):**
[[⚰️ Thyros the Ender]] lies in state, appearing as a tall humanoid figure in simple robes, hands folded, completely still. Neither alive nor dead—suspended in the moment between. Ancient texts say waking Thyros will bring "the end of endings"—but what that means, no one knows.

## **Factions & The Tomb**

By the time players arrive, several factions may have already found or be searching for the tomb:

### **[[⚜️ Vigilant Order]]:**

- Political intrigue—who should control access to god's tomb?

## **Treasures & Artifacts**

### **In the Empty Tombs:**
- Ancient weapons (masterwork quality, magical)
- Burial jewelry (valuable, some with minor enchantments)
- Coins from pre-kingdom era (historically priceless)

- **The Final Word:** Artifact that can permanently kill even gods
- **Crown of Silence:** Grants power over undead and death itself
- **Thyros's Blessing:** Touch from a death god—complicated consequences

**Warning:** Taking artifacts from tomb may break seal, wake Thyros, or attract divine attention from other powers.

## **Environmental Challenges**

### **Cold:**
- Mundane cold resistance not enough above 10,000 feet
- Magical protection required for tomb interior
- Frostbite damage accumulates over time
- Equipment freezes and becomes brittle

### **Altitude:**
- Exhaustion from thin air
- Constitution saves to avoid altitude sickness
- Disadvantage on physical checks above 14,000 feet
- Healing less effective in low oxygen

### **Weather:**
- Blizzards reduce visibility to zero
- Avalanches triggered by loud noises or tremors
- Wind strong enough to knock people prone or off cliffs
- Sudden storms trap expeditions for days

### **Navigation:**
- Easy to get lost in whiteout conditions
- Landmarks buried or changed by snowfall
- Compass interference near tomb (divine energy)
- Time distortion—days feel like hours or vice versa

## **Plot Hooks**

1. **The Race:** Multiple factions hire players to guide them (who do you help?)
2. **The Rescue:** Previous expedition lost on mountain, families offer reward
3. **The Artifact:** Specific item from tomb needed to counter Malachar
4. **The Vision:** Character dreams of tomb, feels called to it
5. **The Warning:** Undead guardian appears in city—"Do not disturb the Ender"
6. **The Theft:** Someone stole map to tomb entrance, must stop them
7. **The Awakening:** Thyros begins to stir—must reseal or prepare for consequences
8. **The Scholar:** Researcher has theory about empty tombs—needs protection to investigate
9. **The Cultist:** [[🌀 Ascendant Cult]] will wake Thyros unless stopped
10. **The Choice:** Open tomb for power to save world, or leave it sealed and risk everything?

## **DM Notes**

### **Pacing:**
- The climb should take real sessions—build tension
- Use weather and encounters to drain resources
- Make reaching tomb feel like major achievement
- The chamber should be awe-inspiring and terrifying

### **The Keeper:**
- Roleplay opportunity—first speaking undead
- Can provide exposition about Thyros and the sealing
- Potential ally if party proves worthy
- Epic boss fight if party seems exploitative

### **Thyros:**
- Should remain mysterious and threatening
- Opening tomb = campaign-defining moment
- Consider whether god should wake or stay sealed
- If awakened, Thyros may be neither good nor evil—just final

### **Moral Complexity:**
- Is it right to disturb a god's rest?
- Are the artifacts worth the risk?
- Should Thyros be awakened to fight Malachar?
- What do the empty tombs mean—failed sacrifice or changed plan?

### **Death & Consequences:**
- Mountain is deadly—characters can die
- Undead guardians are lethal encounters
- Frostbite and altitude are real threats
- Make success feel earned through genuine danger
