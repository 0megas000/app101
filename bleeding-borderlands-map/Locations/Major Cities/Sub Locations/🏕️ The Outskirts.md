# 🏕️ The Outskirts

**Type:** Refugee Camp District  
**Location:** North of [[🎓 Thornwick Academy]] proper  
**Population:** ~6,500 (fluctuating)  
**Status:** Overcrowded temporary settlement becoming permanent

## Description

Sprawling tent city and makeshift housing extending beyond [[🎓 Thornwick Academy]]'s original walls. What began as temporary refugee overflow two years ago has become semi-permanent settlement. Mix of canvas tents, wooden shacks, and repurposed wagons housing displaced people from corrupted regions.

**Layout:**
- No planned organization, organic growth
- Narrow dirt paths between shelters
- Central areas more established, edges newest arrivals
- Some areas have names (Camp Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta)
- Outer edge constantly expanding as more refugees arrive

**Conditions:**
- Overcrowded (designed for 1,000, holds 6,500)
- Poor sanitation (open sewage, disease risk)
- Limited clean water (rationed from city wells)
- Food shortages (aid distribution never enough)
- Crime problems (desperation breeds theft)
- Fire hazards (canvas and wood, cooking fires)
