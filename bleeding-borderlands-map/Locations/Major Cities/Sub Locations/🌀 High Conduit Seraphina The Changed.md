Lady Seraphina Ashcroft, daughter of minor noble family. Lost parents, estate, and fiancé to corruption outbreak. Survived by fleeing into Maelstrom, where she embraced transformation rather than resist it.

Entered corruption zone voluntarily after losing everything. Discovered she could control transformation's pace. Emerged partially changed, powerful, and enlightened with new perspective.

Founded Threshold Commune as sanctuary for those who embraced change. Cult formed around her as living proof transformation could be managed, even beautiful. Became High Conduit through wisdom, not force.

## Roleplay

**Quotes:** _"We do not run from change. We embrace it, guide it, become it. Is that truly so different from your own growth?"_

_"You see corruption. We see potential. You see loss. We see liberation. Perhaps we are not so opposed as you believe."_

_"Brother Kaine speaks of immediacy, of force. But transformation forced is transformation failed. It must be chosen."_

_"Look at me. Am I monster? Am I lost? I am more now than I ever was. Would you deny others that transcendence?"_

## DM Notes

**Using Seraphina:**

- Not cartoonish villain - genuinely believes she's helping
- Can be reasoned with (unlike Kaine)
- Potential ally against worse threats
- Personal tragedy makes her sympathetic
- Transformation is both beautiful/horrifying

**Moral Complexity:**

- Some cult members found peace through her
- Is she wrong if people choose willingly?
- Her methods are gentle compared to alternatives
- But ultimate goal still apocalyptic
