# Goldmeadow

**Type:** Agricultural Village | **Population:** ~800 (pre-crisis: 600)
**Location:** 8 miles south of [[⚜️ Goldspire]], in fertile river valley
**Primary Production:** Grain (wheat, barley) and Livestock (cattle, sheep)
**Faction Control:** [[⚜️ Vigilant Order]] (Heavy Occupation)
**Status:** Tense - Occupied, Strained, Resentful

## **Overview**
Once a peaceful farming community known for golden wheat fields that stretched to the horizon, Goldmeadow now lives under the watchful eye of the Vigilant Order. When the Maelstrom erupted, the Order moved swiftly to "secure vital food supplies for the faithful"—which meant occupying the village with armed templars and seizing control of harvests. The villagers are divided: some grateful for protection from chaos, others bitter about losing autonomy and seeing their food requisitioned while they go hungry.

The village name comes from its fields—acres of wheat that glow like spun gold in late summer. Now those fields feed Goldspire's garrison and Order outposts across the region, with locals receiving barely enough to survive.

## **DM Notes**

### **Running Goldmeadow:**
- Show the human cost of occupation
- Make villagers sympathetic but complicated
- Order templars aren't all evil—some troubled by duty
- Starvation is real—describe emaciated children

- Cult offers tempting alternative to suffering

### **Consequences:**
- Player choices should matter significantly

- Ignore situation = things get worse
- No perfect solution exists

### **Atmosphere:**
- Tension everywhere—fear, hunger, resentment
- Beautiful fields hiding ugly reality
- Children's laughter rare and precious
- Constant presence of armed templars
- Whispered conversations, furtive glances
