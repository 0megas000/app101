# The Threshold Commune

**Type:** Cult Headquarters - Corrupted Fortress | **Population:** ~2,000 cultists
**Location:** Middle Ring of [[🌪️ The Maelstrom]] (6 miles from epicenter)
**Faction Control:** [[🌀 Ascendant Cult]] (exclusive)
**Threat Level:** Extreme - Hostile to outsiders

## **Overview**
An ancient military fortress consumed by the Maelstrom's corruption and claimed by the Ascendant Cult as their sacred home. The stone walls now shift and breathe like living tissue, doors open onto different rooms each time, and hallways stretch or compress based on incomprehensible patterns. To outsiders, it's a nightmare maze. To the cultists, it's paradise—they walk through the chaos with complete confidence, reading the corruption like others read signposts.

The Commune serves as both religious center and transformation sanctuary, where the faithful gather to accelerate their change into something "more than human."

## **DM Notes**

### **Running the Commune:**
- Emphasize the wrongness—everything is slightly off, unsettling
- Cultists should seem both pitiful and terrifying
- Use shifting architecture to create tension and confusion
- Make transformation seem both beautiful and horrifying to them

### **Hostile Encounters:**
- Cultists fight fanatically, no fear of death
- They use corruption as weapon—infecting enemies
- Retreat is rare—they defend their home to the end
- Captured enemies are either converted or killed

### **Moral Complexity:**
- Many members were desperate refugees seeking acceptance
- Some genuinely find peace in transformation
- Not all are evil—just radically committed to different future
- Players might sympathize with some individual cultists

### **Balance:**
- Don't make them cartoon villains
- Show their humanity even as they abandon it
- Give them legitimate grievances against other factions
- Make players question if they're entirely wrong
