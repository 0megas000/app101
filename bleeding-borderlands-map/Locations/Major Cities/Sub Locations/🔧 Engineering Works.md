# Engineering Works

**Type:** Construction Facility | **Location:** Haven's Rest (Industrial Quarter)  
**Size:** Massive complex (5 buildings) | **Workers:** 300+  
**Faction:** Pragmatic Coalition | **Purpose:** Anti-corruption barrier construction

## Overview

Industrial complex where Captain Marcus Steelwright's teams design and build barriers to slow corruption spread. Forges roar, saws scream, and engineers test reality-stabilizing mechanisms. This is where practical solutions to impossible problems are manufactured.

## Key Buildings

**Design Hall:**

- Drafting tables (blueprints for barriers)
- Testing lab (small-scale corruption experiments)
- Marcus Steelwright's office
- Prototype storage

**Main Forge:**

- Metal fabrication (barrier components)
- 12 forges running constantly
- Smiths craft steel framework
- Heat: extreme (DC 15 CON save or 1d6 fire damage per round)

**Assembly Yard:**

- Construct full barrier sections (20ft x 20ft panels)
- Quality testing (stress tests, corruption exposure)
- Staging area (finished sections await transport)
- Cranes and lifting equipment

**Material Storage:**

- Raw steel, stone, timber
- Magical components (crystals, silver, holy water)
- Tools and equipment
- Guarded (theft common, DC 18 Stealth)

**Living Quarters:**

- Worker barracks (300 capacity)
- Mess hall
- Infirmary (industrial accidents frequent)

## D&D 5e Mechanics

**Barrier Sections:**

- AC 18, 200 HP per 20ft section
- Slows corruption advance by 80%
- Cost: 5,000 GP per section
- Construction: 1 week per section

**Working Here:**

- Pay: 2 GP per day (skilled labor)
- Risk: DC 12 DEX save daily or minor injury (1d4 damage)
- Skills: Smith's Tools, Engineering, Athletics

**Stealing Components:**

- DC 18 Stealth (guards patrol)
- Magical components worth 500-2,000 GP
- Blueprints worth 1,000 GP to enemy factions

## NPCs

**Captain Marcus Steelwright** (CR 7, chief engineer)  
**Master Smith Garrick** (CR 4, forge master)  
**300 Workers** (CR 1/2-2, various skills)  
**20 Guards** (CR 2)

## Plot Hooks

- Sabotage barrier production
- Steal anti-corruption designs
- Protect facility from assault
- Commission custom barrier
- Investigate worker accidents (sabotage?)
