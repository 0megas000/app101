# 🏭 The Old Mill

**Location:** [[🏘️ Millhaven]] village center  
**Operator:** Miller Thomas (age 55, gruff but helpful)  
**Corruption Level:** Level 1 (Reality Flutter)  
**Status:** Functional but phasing in/out of reality

## Description
Three-story stone mill with 20-foot waterwheel that phases between dimensions every 3-6 minutes. Sometimes solid, sometimes translucent, always unpredictable. Still produces flour when wheel is stable.

## Key Features
- **Waterwheel:** Phases in/out unpredictably, sometimes spins backwards
- **Millstones:** Grind grain when wheel works, sometimes grind nothing
- **Strange Flour:** 10% of flour has faint shimmer, causes minor magical effects (see colors, hear whispers - harmless but weird)

## Miller Thomas
**Attitude:** Suspicious of outsiders, warms if respectful  
**Knows:** Corruption warning signs, phase patterns, his wife disappeared 6 months ago  
**Quest:** Wants strange flour analyzed by [[🧪 Dr. Elara Voss]]  
**Secret:** Sees his transformed wife at corruption edge sometimes

## Night Event (Session 1)
At 2 AM, mill fully phases out for 10 minutes. Miller runs outside panicking.
- Party can investigate or go back to sleep
- **Investigation DC 14:** Learn phase patterns correlate with planar alignments
- **Insight DC 15:** Miller is watching horizon, not the mill

## Loot/Resources
- Strange flour samples (valuable to Academy)
- Observation of corruption effects (research data)
