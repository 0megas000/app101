#### Description

Goldspire rises like a divine vision from three connected hills, its white marble walls gleaming with gold-painted accents that catch the sun like captured starlight. Twelve golden spires pierce the sky, the tallest reaching 220 feet and visible from forty miles away.

The city radiates wealth and divine authority. Cathedral bells ring the hours while incense drifts from countless shrines. The streets are paved with fitted stone, and golden symbols of the Vigilant Order mark important buildings. Despite the crisis, the city maintains an air of prosperity and unshakeable faith.
